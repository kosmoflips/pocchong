<h2>2010.10.18 .1 - On the way~everything's all right</h2>

<div class="p">After Toulouse's stage, I went to Brest, London, and Cologe.</div>

<div class="p">After tomorrow's show in Paris, finally this tour is going to end.<br />
Although it went by so quickly, I really encountered a lot from it.</div>

<div class="p">The Internet connection was not very good, plus we had to stay late for the performance,<br />
and get up early for the moving, I hardly wrote since Toulouse.<br />
Yet KOKIA is on the way, and everything is all right.</div>

<div class="p">With one small suitcase, I feel like I can go to anywhere.<br />
My heart is travelling around the world. I remembered it again.</div>

<div class="p">After Paris' stage, I am going back to Japan.<br />
I will report the continued trip later, at here, otonami, so please wait for that.</div>
