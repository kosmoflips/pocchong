<h2>2010.10.08 - Moscow ♪</h2>

<div class="p">We arrived at Moscow.<br />
"Ahh, finally we came to this place."<br />
yet I did not realise this until we visited Red Square with the chilling wind.</div>

<div class="p">But I would like to say Moscow is not that cold than I thought. ^^;</div>

<div class="p">Although being in the neighborhood of other countries, I did not have much of information comparing others.<br />
This is the most mysterious country for me.<br />
With lots of races, a huge amount of history has been embedded in this country.<br />
Even only a little, I hope I can feel more about this country through my live here.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/russia3.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Beyond my thought, this city has a peaceful ambience of a mixture of the modern and the past.<br />
Cars were crowded, and everywhere gave me a feeling like Disney Land or Las Vegas;<br />
this was such an impressive and unique monument.</div>

<div class="p">There were a lot of 24-7 stores, and even in a small supermarket, everything was placed in a row,<br />
which was also beyond my thought, very.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/russia1.jpg" alt="" />　

<div class="p">Saint Basil's Cathedral, which is famous for Tetris... (?)<br />
when I saw it for real, although it may be a bit impolite to a world legacy... ^_^; it was like a Papier-mâché.<br />
is it because that its gloss has faded away?!</div>

<div class="p">And look from this aspect, it was a bit like the Aladdin area in the Disney Land,<br />
really...<br />
I was excited by the exotic mood, and I was lost in the fantastic world.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/russia10_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Since we have come to Russia... there must be Russian soup.<br />
Then, Matryoshka and salmon roe.<br />
Actually, the word of the salmon roe in Japanese sushi "Ikura" was originated from Russian,<br />
"Ikura = egg", and thus, "Ikura" is real Russian.<br />
There we tried the sushi made by real Russian "ikura".</div>

<div class="p">↓ Russian soup~　　　　　　　　　　　　↓ Matryoshka and salmon row~</div>

<div class="p">They were amazingly delicious.</div>

<div class="p">Well, in the dawn, under Moscow's autumn sunny sky,<br />
being surrounded in the beautiful green and red leaves, we entered in the "Koncert".</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/russia5.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">The first performance in Russia.<br />
The concert was like a club meeting, where people listened to my singing, and enjoy the food.<br />
This day's ambience was very like the first live house after my debut,<br />
and I felt like to recall that period of memory. For people who was in rear, I have to make my voice going that far!</div>

<div class="p">How many people attend to the concert, how large the live house is, such things are not important at all,<br />
I just hope I can spread the seed around this place, and someday, they can finally sprout.<br />
I just sing with my heart.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/russia8.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/russia11_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Spread my voice.</div>

<div class="p">I will be like this, all the way.<br />
Step by step, from now on.</div>

<div class="p">I want to go to the place where people can cling together, and sing for them,<br />
and this day's stage was in such a thought.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/russia9.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Russia → Munich → Berlin → Poland</div>
