<h2>2010.10.12 - Wien ♪</h2>

<div class="p">We arrived in Vienna, the city of music.<br />
Since Hungary, Russia and Poland, I have been accustomed to the moving-and-singing days.</div>

<div class="p">One of the excitement in the trip, "food".<br />
In Austria, first we tried Schnitzel and Brezel.</div>

<div class="p">I used to be in an Europe trip with my family when I was in high school.<br />
Then, we attend to the New Year Concert in Austria.<br />
I dressed up more maturely, and was walking around the city.<br />
After that, a long time later, I have been a musician, and now visited the city again.</div>

<div class="p">I have really a wonderful moon.</div>

<div class="p">In the big hall of Viennese Music Association, listening to Strass' waltz conducted by Mehta.<br />
without realising it, I was smiling, and now, the bright melodies were still echoing in my heart.</div>

<div class="p">This city fits Strass' waltz very well.<br />
Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms.<br />
There were a lot of famous musicians ever being in this city,<br />
and their wonderful music is still here. I appreciated that I could still touch their music,<br />
and I hope, maybe later, my songs will be left someone's heart.</div>

<div class="p">Chairs were arranged well in today's live house, it must be a happy time.</div>

<div class="p">"Guten tag ＾＿＾／"</div>

<div class="p">This was the first performance since that in Moscow,<br />
and I was excited to see the audience;</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://kokia.com/blog/Image/wien_nakamura3.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">In Japan, or other countries, young people, older people,<br />
different people gathering in the same place, share the same feeling.<br />
Looking at their enjoying faces from the stage,<br />
I was also very happy.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://kokia.com/blog/Image/wien_nakamura4.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Here I am starting my concert in Austria!<br />
This was a nice step in the very beginning.</div>

<div class="p">Even my suitcase looked like being accustomed to the trip.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://kokia.com/blog/Image/wien0.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">The next morning, we were going to Munich, and I forced myself to get up early.<br />
No matter what, I wanted to visit one place, The Central Cemetery where musicians are resting in peace.</div>

<div class="p">"Mozart, I know I am not a popular musician comparing to you,<br />
but could you think that I am a lucky person? ^^"</div>

<div class="p">With others' roses and the calm air,<br />
my mind was left in the peaceful place.</div>
