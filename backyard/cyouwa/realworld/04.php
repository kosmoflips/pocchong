<h2>2010.10.06 - Works in Paris ★★★</h2>

<div class="p">Departing from Hungary, we entered Paris.</div>

<div class="p">There are still three days until the first performance in Moscow,<br />
we are now doing the general works, while taking a rest.</div>

<div class="p">I spent two weeks in Paris during the period of my photo exhibition in June,<br />
and now I feel like I'm still staying in that time.</div>

<div class="p">As soon as we arrived at Paris, we went to meet up with Musshu Nakamura,<br />
who is the official camera man for this Europe tour.</div>

<div class="p">In a restaurant inside Louvre where we can see The Eiffel Tower,<br />
we "cheers" for a safe tour. Well, we drank shuwa-shuwa, of course. ＾＿＾／</div>

<div class="p">I'm looking forward what kind of photos Nakamura would take,<br />
which reflect the "moments" of my "heart".</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/paris6.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">At daybreak, working in Pairs.</div>

<div class="p">Today I was in an interview for the television and magazine.<br />
Even though there are generally one or two photos appearing in a magazine,<br />
the camera man always takes about 300 photos for each time. That was really a huge amount.</div>

<div class="p">Unfortunately, this day was cloudy with a light shower.<br />
Yet after work, we still visited the Eiffel Tower and the Triumphal Arch before dinner.</div>

<div class="p">No matter how many times I come to Paris and see this city, streets and buildings here are beautiful and elegant.</div>

<div class="p">Currently, it is the time of both Paris Fashion Week and a world-famous auto-show.<br />
There are more people than usual, I think.</div>

<div class="p">↓ Going by taking the metro of Paris.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/paris9.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">In June, I first time used a bicycle called Velib to go around Paris.</div>

<div class="p">This time, the hotel is close to the first circle of Paris, thus I used the metro.<br />
No matter which, both of them are helpful to memorize locations in this city.</div>

<div class="p">In both Japan and Paris, I always visit a store called Tsumori,<br />
and I went to one today in the Marais district.<br />
This is the only store in Paris that I can pinpoint quickly and know more than anyone else.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/paris7.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Van Cleef &amp; Arpels in Place Vendôme.<br />
Casually, I bought a suitcase, which was the collaboration of Globe trotter and tsumori chisato,<br />
in tsumori chisato in Marais district.<br />
Actually, the release time in Japan did not match my departure, so I could not buy that there.</div>

<div class="p">When I found that in Paris, "Ahh, that's miracle!! ^^"<br />
Taking only a few seconds, I bought it immediately.</div>

<div class="p">and I felt like encountering an old friend from Japan.</div>

<div class="p">Because we could only take the flight from Paris to Russia,<br />
I only need a smaller suitcase for around 2-3 days' stuff,<br />
and for the larger trunk, it will be fine since there will be a caravan when we arrive at Berlin.</div>

<div class="p">... Thus, staff from Paris gave me lots of suggestions,<br />
all were like "You came to Paris to meet her!"<br />
and I was very pleased by such a story... ^^; There I bought it.</div>

<div class="p">With such a nice suitcase,<br />
I feel like I can go to anywhere in this trip.<br />
First, let's go to Russia together.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/paris8.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">The three days being Paris, the interview, the autographing session, and the unexpected shopping...<br />
the time went by so quickly.</div>

<div class="p">Tonight, finally we are going to Russia.<br />
There is no non-stop route from Paris to Moscow, and it may be exhausting,<br />
yet talking about an agitated trip, I will go with what I got from <b>"When in Rome"</b>.</div>

<div class="p">It will also be a fight with to take a good rest during the moving<br />
before the performances in Russia and Poland end.</div>

<div class="p">It is my first time to be in that country,<br />
what kind of time will I have with Red Square and Matryoshka dolls,<br />
as well as Russian food and soup?</div>

<div class="p">and how will feel two weeks later,<br />
when I come back to Paris for the final performance of this tour...?</div>

<div class="p">Anyway, toward Moscow, here I go! ＾＿＾／</div>
