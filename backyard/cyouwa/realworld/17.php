<h2>2010.10.20 - Brest ♪</h2>

<div class="p">I was welcomed by the comfortable and fresh sea breeze this morning in Brest.<br />
Looking at the yachts and people living there.</div>

<div class="p">Ahh, it's so wonderful to be in such a scenery.</div>

<div class="p">It will be so nice to become older in that way~<br />
for a while, by looking at the old couples, I was dreaming about my own unknown future.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/brest0_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">流石の気持ち良さに、あともう少しだけこの街に留まっていたいなぁっと<br />
ほんの少し浮気な心で日だまりを楽しんでいました。</div>

<div class="p">It will take about 2 to 3 hours to arrive at Brest, today's stage.</div>

<div class="p">There are four places in France I am visiting this time, but here, Brest,<br />
has a strong influence of Celtic music. Therefore, since I have spent a lot of time<br />
to record in Ireland and go around there, I was very excited to visit this city.</div>

<div class="p">People were moving from the southwest of the British Isles to this place,<br />
and thus, here is also called Bretagne, which was derived from the British Isles.</div>

<div class="p">Celtic people are called Bretons in France;<br />
in this area, the Celtic language and culture were kept.</div>

<div class="p">After communicated with people from central France, here, in this area,<br />
I felt the culture of people living here are very different from the central France.<br />
If use Japan as an example, here is like Okinawa...?</div>

<div class="p">↓ In front of the live house.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/burest2_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">At somewhere in a distant country. This place amazingly fits that words.</div>

<div class="p">To have stages in more places in France,<br />
so I have been in Paris, Marseilles, and Toulouse, which I have heard about before,<br />
but here, Brest, is a place I just knew from this tour, and just visited for the first time.</div>

<div class="p">Because of that!, "people from the distant country" were gathering and listening to my songs.<br />
This night had such a wonderful meet &amp; greet time, just like a miracle.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/brest4_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Maybe to say like this is a bit impolite... just like the song describes,<br />
"Barubaru kitayo Hakodate~"♪<br />
I am really in the city called Brest, so I am really in France, no?<br />
Lot of people went here for me.</div>

<div class="p">France ♡ my love <img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/brest_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Even though there are only around 5, 6 Japanese living in Brest, I still met them,<br />
and somehow, the song "Because the Earth is round" is echoing in my mind again.</div>

<div class="p">↓ After the show, attending the interview of students.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/brest2_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Crepe, galette, and cidre, they all make Brest famous,<br />
and thus, tonight we had crepe.</div>

<div class="p">What I chose was the fat-liver crepe (galette).<br />
It was different from what you eat in Japan, first, you will have the main dish crepe,<br />
and later, they will serve the dessert crepe.<br />
There are also some people ordered different kinds of crepe.</div>

<div class="p">There are also crepe restaurants in Japan where you can enjoy this style. ＾＾／</div>

<div class="p">I think my blog is going to be like one introducing delicious food in my trip...<br />
yet I will also report the rest part of this tour, please enjoy that.</div>
