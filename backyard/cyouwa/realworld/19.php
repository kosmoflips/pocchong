<h2>2010.10.22 - London ♪ 〜Moving in the night</h2>

<div class="p">Today has a stage in London, yet in this morning, our destination was Calrs, France.<br />
And this morning, we and our camping car went to ferry together.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/lon.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">"Now, toward England, we are going across the Strait of Dover." ＾＿＾／<br />
The sky was very clear, and the weather was always good during the tour.<br />
Thus I have seen a lot from the country I was visiting,<br />
and it was also a performance from the sky and the light, with its sunny, cloudy, rainy and windy minds.</div>

<div class="p">A huge task in the last part of the tour, until the final day in Paris it will be another 3-stages-in-a-row!!</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/lon2_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Going onto the deck, the couples were already in titanic mode.<br />
Yet even I showed my "Air-hug" immediately. ^^;<br />
Sorry, I was over-excited.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/lon1_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">After the strait, be back to a normal mode, we entered in England.<br />
Walking on the streets in London, where red buses with black captions running,<br />
I was very happy to finally be here. I know there are lots of people from London to Paris for my concerts there.<br />
I will enjoy today's performance.</div>

<div class="p">I could hear the audience's enthusiasm in the dressing room. To be honest, and the schedule was really tight.<br />
Like this, repeat moving and singing all the way, I was worrying about if I could keep in a well-condition,<br />
But I would just sing with my feeling of thankfulness, to reply the audience who were supporting me.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/lon3_nakamura.jpg" alt="" />　<img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/lon4_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/lon5_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">There are always guests except for my friends, acknowledgements, or relatives being in my concert,<br />
and today's surprise was Musshu's older brother, who was coming from Japan.<br />
We got the gift, truffle chocolate being decorated with the letter "K" from "KOKIA". ^^</div>

<div class="p">So cute, and so delicious. ＾＿＾／</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/lon7_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">After the stage, by the escort of Musshu's brother, we took a short visiting in London.</div>

<div class="p">Tower Bridge in the night, isn't it elegant?</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/lon6_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">After the stage, what was waiting for us, who just lived elegantly for a while,<br />
was another ferry departing at 3AM.</div>

<div class="p">Of course, tonight had no sleeping time. ^^;</div>

<div class="p">Being half-sleeping, we went across Dover again,<br />
and from France, we arrived Cologne, Germany,<br />
in the next morning.</div>

<div class="p">Still the chilling car, and our fight with the sleepiness and coldness.<br />
Eh? Is here a snowy mountain~~~???</div>

<div class="p">To cry, to laugh, to say it's tight or some else, there are still two stages to go.<br />
I will still do my best, to have nice times in Cologne and Paris.</div>
