<div class="p"><i>Listed in chronological order based on its first round completion.</i></div>

<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="saya-no-uta">[PC] 沙耶の唄 / Saya no Uta (★☆)</h4>
<div class="p">My first horror game! As that one day I told someone "I'll show you I have the guts to play horror games." and thus he brought me this, which ended my Famicom+minesweeper period!<br />
In a sense, it did scare me, the sound effect and the jumping out "bad" CG's -- It's a perfect 18+ game (I feel like being deceived). And at the end, I'm literally saved by it's lack of choices. The gore stuff isn't that bad though.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="corpseparty-bc">[PSP] Corpse Party -Blood Covered Repeated Fear- (★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">Multiple wrong ends have much more fun than solely enjoying the main story. Collecting name tags is fun too (and the later autopsy). In this game, whenever I see a dead body, I get excited as the collection is one step closer to be completed. -- the antique doll's laugh is my favourite.<br />
Traumatic death, Naomi in the infirmary. Plus that you can't skip any text.<br />
(Later on, I watched someone playing Corpse Party -Book of Shadows-, especially the last hidden chapter.)</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="artonelico1">[PS2] Ar Tonelico (★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">I was deceived by the gorgeous hymmnos to play this. A not so bad RPG, but may be too easy and the story is short in "nutrition" -- everything is like in a perfect flow and thus has no fun.
Frankly, it's still great to recognise different songs during the game play. The <a href="http://gustwiki.com/ar-tonelico/wiki/83.html" target="_blank">power-up system</a> is fun too (although a little tiresome). But, the dive-system is rubbish!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="silenthill1">[PS] SILENT HILL (★★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">It makes me nervous even at 5th play. The idea of the parallel otherworld is attractive. Riddles are serious, 2+ round's bonus is rich (and strict) -- Although it was hard for me that the difficulty increased after each round. And music is marvellous.<br />
<i>-- No need to waste more words. This one is a classic.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="artonelico2">[PS2] Ar Tonelico 2 (★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">First, the graphic quality was downed so much. Second, besides the dive-system (Jakuri's lv1~5 are okay), the new <a href="http://gustwiki.com/ar-tonelico2/wiki/154.html" target="_blank">IPD-therapy-system</a> is even more boring. But the main story is better than A.T.1, and not only hymmnos (yuri ftw), more funny talks, and the soundtracks are also getting even better. Some synchro-magic's animations are beautiful (especially Croche's some magic that I forget its name).<br />
No A.T. 3 as I hate its battle system, and the story is absurd.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="silenthill3">[PC/PS3] SILENT HILL 3 (★★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">The after story of Silent Hill 1... although not exactly of that type. To finish SH1's good+ ending would be a good idea before doing this game. It's even scarier than SH1, thanks for the well-down otherworld and Kenji Kawai's sound effect (I was stalled for quite a while after applying blood bag on to the alter in the hospital). Riddles on hard mode are attempting to empty my brain-paste, but they are fun to work with anyways.<br />
The No.1 regret: Harry is the coolest dad! He's invincible!!<br />
And somehow I liked Vincent.. ^^;</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="biohazard1">[PS] BIOHAZARD (★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">A big hit across the history of survival horror. The graphic is more colourful compared to SH series, which somehow reduced its feeling of fear. With two main characters, the story for each isn't complementary to each other but is in the form parallel worlds (I'd prefer the former though). Riddles are straightforward; while Chris is limited to carry 6 items max (which is so unreasonable) makes this game harder in a different sense (mostly I only go with Chris as his HP is higher). Hunters are yet still the biggest headache maker.<br />
The ending theme song is amazing!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="silenthill2">[PC/PS3] SILENT HILL 2 (★★★★★★ x ∞)</h4>
<div class="p">The story, the music, the lingering red pyramid thing, the "bug room" near the prison, the endless stairs, the elevator that can't hold even one more photo... <span class="bigger"><b>The best game ever!</b></span><br />
The end.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="gakkouwa">[PS] 学校であった怖い話S / Gakkou de atta Kowai Hanashi S (★★☆)</h4>
<div class="p">A text based horror game, a ghost story collection, and it's indeed scary (and sometimes funny). But in order to get all stories, a <a href="http://www.akkan.sakura.ne.jp/gakkou/scenario-gs.html" target="_blank">scenario chart</a> will be super helpful.<br />
In a word, Akemi's death traps are scariest!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="aooni">[PC] 青鬼 / Ao Oni (★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p"><a href="http://mygames888.info/aooni.html" target="_blank">Having riddles and a fairly big map, it's a great free horror game.</a> The goal is straightforward, to escape from the closed house, while avoiding being captured by the randomly showing up blue demon (ao-oni). Depending the version, Hiroshi's (the main character) friends may or may not survive.<br />
And it's fun to watch others' play and see their reaction!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="majo-ie">[PC] 魔女の家 / Majo no Ie (★★★☆)</h4>
<div class="p">Like Corpse Party, a big entertainment of this game is to die in various death traps! While the true end is of course a very shocking one.<br />
I can't do no-save. Give up!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="ib">[PC] Ib (★★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p"><a href="http://kouri.kuchinawa.com/game_01.html" target="_blank">Perhaps the best free game I've seen so far.</a> That even Shimotsuki Haruka had an album for it! The game itself isn't hard at all, and it's very easy to get all artworks/endings, but it is really addictive; one of Mary's endings reminds me Corpse Party.. xD<br />
A little girl plus a young man definitely make a moe party!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="cthulhu"><s>[PC] Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth</s></h4>
<div class="p">Maybe the 1st person mode makes it very scary. I wish I could finish it, but I can't -- due to the serious motion sickness in 1st person view mode!<br />
However, why as a detective, he doesn't even have a lighter, or some matches? What a useless guy!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="biohazard2">[PS] BIOHAZARD 2 (★★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">The system is much improved, and the stories are more richly rendered (although I want to know which one is the official "true story"). Both the Ex battles and 4th survivor are great too. While the riddles are not fun though. However, the knief is just as weak as in Silent Hill -- although I'm never planning to do a knief clear in Bio2.<br />
This may also be the only Biohazard that I can do with no save (hunters aren't present!).</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="biohazard3">[PS] BIOHAZARD 3: Last Escape (★★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">With lots of improvements in the system (e.g. quick turn, dodge), the riddles are just becoming more time-wasting, so do make sure <a href="http://www.syumimania.com/bio3/solve-a-device.html" target="_blank">the answers</a> are always ready. Mr. Nemesis is serious compared to Tyrant in Bio2; live actions may sometimes help you to kill zombies in batch; using herbs will lower your play rank just like first aid spray... so there are both good and bad changes. As the second part of Raccoon City's the last moment, I like how it ends.<br />
End1: Carlos is the hero, and Jill is the heroine.<br />
End2: Jill's old partner comes to help her, Carlos becomes pure air.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="clocktower">[PS] Clock Tower 2 &amp; Clock Tower (★)</h4>
<div class="p">I've never seen such a badly made horror game. As an escape game, the system is hard to control, and the story-telling is not explaining anything. So I dropped half way and directly went to youtube.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="silenthill4">[PS2] SILENT HILL 4: The Room (★★★★☆)</h4>
<div class="p">SH4 is like an evolution. No riddles, no searching for maps, for the first time guns are less useful, and there's even an item box being integrated! But it's still fun to play: to chase the past truth, and escape from the trapped room. This is also the first Silent Hill I did in normal since the very beginning. Meanwhile, more great music and songs here! "Tender Sugar" is my top love! The 2D only controlling mode is confusing and a pain when the camera angle being fixed.<br />
The bad thing is, the hospital is too short, and no otherworld for it!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="shadowhearts1">[PS2] Shadow Hearts (★★★★☆)</h4>
<div class="p">This series stands out in all RPG's I've played. The system is not hard: no complicated power-up, which is good for me who is bad at parameter-settings. While the judgement ring system is interesting, and sometimes may be a little challenging. But non-party characters won't gain any EXP is a pain, so it's not easy to switch, and I'm not a levelling-up lover. The story is well arranged, blending with both fantastic and realistic aspects; but a <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/sky_peace000/sd_1/index.htm" target="_blank">good play guide</a> is definitely necessary in order to collect all hidden items/dungeons/etc.<br />
A shocking truth: the bad end is actually the true end.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="shadowhearts2">[PS2] Shadow Hearts II (★★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">Like Shadow Hearts 1, without a <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/sky_peace000/sd_2/index.htm" target="_blank">good play guide</a>, to enjoy all aspects would be exhausting. More funny characters are present this time so the overall ambience is lighter than the previous, and all cut-scene 3D animations are rendered of a higher quality. Flagging is less stressful, and there're more sub-events/dungeons. The 30k HP Seven-Lucky-God boss is awesome, and I love Joachim's tuna weapon!<br />
P.S. for the sake of cast voice, I enjoy every scene in which Nicolai is present! xD</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="biohazard-veronica">[PS3] BIOHAZARD -CODE: Veronica- (★★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">The most unfriendly Biohazard among 1~5. The map is huge, items are too dark to be seen, death traps are not few, and even hunters are poisonous! But I'm really happy to see both Claire and Chris being in action. The rifle-involved boss fight was the first dying stage that caused me 2 hours, longer than the last-boss!
btw, I already knew Steve would die due to its soundtracks...<br />
Alexia's aria is beautiful.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="biohazard4">[PS3] BIOHAZARD 4 (★★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p"><b>Leon is such an ikenmen!!</b> xDD<br />
From survival horror to action, although I kept dying and spending hours with Salazar and Krause, I like this game a lot. While complaining how annoying Ashley is, if you think over without her, we won't be able to play with Leon at all. ^^;
But the in cutscene-film live command is another pain, I just want to focus on the film, not the bottom of the screen!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="biohazard5">[PS3] BIOHAZARD 5 (★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">No major changes from Bio4, except that you can change weapons using arrow keys. This made me spending some time to get used to. The story here draws a conclusion (?) with Wesker. As an evil character, he's the only one who I don't want him to die. Also, I don't want to be mean to Sheva, but I wish Chris and Jill can be together in the main story. Therefore I like the "lost in nightmare" side story more. Remember to collect all <a href="game-kouryaku.info/biohazard5/bsaa.html" target="_blank">BSAA emblems</a>.<br />
And it's fun to see when you shoot off the Gatling-Guy's beret.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="atelier-rorona">[PS3] New Atelier Rorona (★★★★☆)</h4>
<div class="p">I couldn't say no to them because the characters and arts are so moe. I don't like tsundere, but I don't mind an airhead. However, a nice <a href="http://wikiwiki.jp/newrorona/?%B9%B6%CE%AC%A5%E1%A5%E2" target="_blank">walkthrough</a> is needed to reduce your vain effort in fighting those stupidly strong bosses. With a walkthrough, I'm okay with the complicated gear/item preparation, but the only complaint would be, the lv50 requirement for the true end, while the necessary party member is a tsundere...<br />
The remake version has an extended year, so in a sense it's easier to prepare for the next round (in order to not play more rounds in future).</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="atelier-totori">[PS3] Atelier Totori (★★★★☆)</h4>
<div class="p">After the first round of Rorona with my vain efforts, I realised a <a href="http://amuwiki.com/totori/?%A5%AD%A5%E3%A5%E9%CA%CC%A5%A8%A5%F3%A5%C9" target="_blank">walkthrough</a> is a must-see for the whole atelier series. Everything is cute as usual, and the lv50 requirement for the true end is present as usual, while asking for another tsundere being one of them... What is the develop staff thinking about?! I want to through the staff into her alchemical pot...<br />
Totori in Rorona's extended year is super cute.
<span class="smaller">At last, no Meruru, as I don't like her based on a few fragmented game play videos I watched.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="shadowhearts3">[PS2] Shadow Hearts: From the New World (★★★★☆)</h4>
<div class="p">A <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/sky_peace000/sd_3/index.htm" target="_blank">walkthrough</a> is needed with no exception! Not directly linked back to the two previous games, so this time, the one who can use fusion monsters isn't in my party at all (I'm even happy with the "bad end", the BGM is cool). The combo system becomes a bit more complicated, but once you get used to it, it's not that hard. The additional skill plates are easier to manage as well.<br />
The scene with Akiko's aria is surely my top 1 cutscene.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="atelier-iris">[PS2] Atelier Iris (☆)</h4>
<div class="p">No, it's not like the atelier series, it's just a GUST-ish RPG that lacks even the most basic balance... -__-</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="zero1">[PS2] Fatal Frame / 零 -Zero- (★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">Lots of people say you're brave if you can play it at night. But I'm still scared by Silent Hill regardless I usually play this game after 22:00 with only the light from my desk lamp. Ghosts here aren't that scary anyways, and the girls are cute, so there's no reason for me to be scared! Yet it doesn't mean this game is easy. The 2D mode is another pain, especially when the camera angle changes. The top 1 death causing ghost is the blind woman, not even Kirie the last-boss who has instant death attack.<br />
The true end is not acceptable. How come Mafuyu can choose to stay with a girl who he just met for a few days instead of going back with his real sister?<br />
And remember to complete your <a href="http://ryvo2.web.fc2.com/zero/zero.html" target="_blank">ghost list</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="zero2">[PS2] Fatal Frame 2 / 零 -紅い蝶- (★★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">System is improved so the battles are easier to handle the power-up. The graphic is so beautiful, and therefore even less horror xD; (let me call this series <b>healing horror!</b>). I clearly remember that around chapter 5-7, I lost my goal and got stuck and didn't know what to do next...<br />
This time, the true end is better. The alternative end is turning Mayu to a complete evil.<br />
The black-and-white scene while being chased by Sae is the very part with a really high tension!<br />
Again, go completing the <a href="http://www.psychelia2.com/butterfly/butterfly_index2.html" target="_blank">ghost list!</a></div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="zero3">[PS2] Fatal Frame 3 / 零 -刺青の聲- (★★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">Let me put the <a href="http://www.psychelia2.com/voice/voice_index2.html" target="_blank">ghostlist</a> at the very beginning!<br />
This one is the hardest among all the three. Because there're so many characters, cameras and lens, which means lots of points are required. But the story is good as usual (although due to character change it's sometimes confusing), and the after-clear costumes are pretty, so I won't complain too much.<br />
The floating shrine girls are the most annoying (and they appear in group!).</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="atelier-iris2">[PS2] Atelier Iris 2 (★☆)</h4>
<div class="p">No much difference from Iris 1 but as a whole is more balanced so I didn't drop halfway. But such a plain story can't satisfy me anymore, so I had no further interest to do Iris 3 at all.<br />
done.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="silenthill0">[PSP] SILENT HILL 0 (★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">Being released on PSP, the quality isn't bad. At first, I wasn't used to its battle system, that you can beat the monsters with bare hand. It's reasonable, but I couldn't thinking this must hurt a lot. xD;; The develop team loves Shakespeare as usual, but he's not involved in any riddles this time. Riddles are aren't hard at all, while the doll-and-pill one is interesting. Overall, the difficulty is much easier, and thus it's the first Silent Hill I ever did with a high completion. And I'm glad to meet Pyramid Head's cousin here!<br />
With unlimited laser gun (?), the outfit that won't consume stamina and the night vision goggle, Silent Hill thus becomes Silent Kill!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="atelier-ayesha">[PSV] Atelier Ayesha Plus (★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">Of course a <a href="http://omoteura.com/atelier_ayesha/mix_technic02.html" target="_blank">guide for making items</a> is necessary. While the alchemy &amp; battle systems are more complicated, the flagging issue became much easier. Thankfully, to obtain all ends only took me 2 rounds, together with beating all the extra bosses in the Plus version.<br />
Speaking of endings, the true end is <b>very disappointing</b>; and my favourite one is certainly the Keith end.<br />
However, where is the dango-like cute moster puni???<br />
<span class="smaller">No Escha &amp; Logy anyway. After watching the anime, I believe I won't like her at all.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="corpseparty-bd">[PSV] Corpse Party -Blood Drive- (★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">The long time waiting Corpse Party finally comes to the final conclusion. The after story isn't bad actually, and I'm happy with it (thus it links to the beginning of Corpse Party 2). But the system isn't that happy at all: loading is way too long, and sometimes there are bugs that force the game to exit (even after patching v1.2). However, each chapter's arrangement lacks a certain smooth flow. Although also coming again into the mutated Tenjin Elementary, everyone except Ayumi and Yoshiki are just like extra. I also saw lots of <a href="http://www.pocchong.de/post/589">déjà vu's</a> that made me laugh in another sense.<br />
Traumatic death: Yoshiki in the pool!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="trustybell">[PS3] Trusty Bell (★★★★☆)</h4>
<div class="p">A CERO-A game which is perfects in terms of graphic, music, and character design (no more comments), quite good in terms of battle system, may cause strong <b>complex</b> in terms of the story.<br />
The battle system is like a hybrid of a turn-based action; interesting but isn't well balanced, as the view is fixed, to move characters and reach the right target is tricky, harmonic chain is hard to activate. Guard is crucial, way too crucial (plus that there's often than half second for you to respond) that I gave up my 2nd round.<br />
Then the story, I'd have no problem if not considering the main character is him... yet still don't want to bring his name up. orz<br />
Of course I won't forget to attach the <a href="http://elemental-garden.net/trustybell/" target="_blank">walkthrough address</a> just in case I want to finish my 2nd round some time.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="yomawari">[PSV] 夜廻 / Yomawari (★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p"><s>A.k.a, Alice in Nightland.</s><br />
In tutorial, you'll know how to select items and use it, and thus you'll kill your doggy in order to let the story begin. Dog lovers shouldn't play this -- not a problem for me at all though. xDD<br />
The main entertaining point of this game is (not) to die among all those weird things! I think they should change the dying-30-times trophy to 300 times. The <a href="http://yomawari.gamerlando.com/collect.html" target="_blank">collection list</a> is another big thing to complete. The ending theme melody was great, that many people said they were deceived to buy it due to that!<br />
Yet my only complaint is the story was told in such an ambiguous way.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="htolniq">[PSV] htoL#NiQ -ホタルノニッキ- / Hotaru no Nikki (★★★★)</h4>
<div class="p">Probably many people were deceived to buy it due to kawaii Mion and the beautiful picture book styled art (maybe also Sakamoto Maaya's voice film). I bought this game because I heard this is very dark. ^^;<br />
While the touch control sounded interesting but was hard, dying is much more brutal (The staff should change the 100 to 1000 in that trophy!). Almost every stage has an evil death trap. Among these, the irritating maze x2 must be the most "popular" (I'll challenge the 2'10'' trophy when I can do BIOHAZARD 5 professional with no problem). About the impossible-to-be-perfect stage 4 quiz-fight, I cheated with my digital camera. As for the true last boss fight, I didn't even know what I was doing out of the whole mess. lol<br />
The "normal" end was more of my preferrence.</div>
