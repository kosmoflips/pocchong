<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="01">沙耶の唄 / Saya no Uta</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/saya_no_uta.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">One day I told someone "I'll show you I have the guts to play horror games." so he brought me this one. This game marks the end of my Famicom+minesweeper period!</div>
<div class="p">Before I didn't know how it feels while doing a horror game, but once I began playing, I was really in it and finished it in just 3 days. I was indeed scared for a lot of moments, and sometimes, even only by the sound effect. So that's how you feel, as a result I enjoyed very much.</div>
<div class="p">Across the whole game there are only like 3 options and every one affects the ending. A good thing here is you can save right before you make the choice. I can't recall many details of each ending, but I still remember the final scenes about both the Female Doctor and the last surviving university friend (whose names I forgot) were quite shocking and were more impressive than the true ending.</div>
<div class="p">I never knew a visual novel can be that scary; the overall quality is good, and can be even better if they could remove those unpleasant 18+ contents. <s>(who told you it's a horror game? It's an adult game since the very beginning!)</s></div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="02">Corpse Party -Blood Covered Repeated Fear-</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/corpse_party_bloodcovered.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">After dying 10+ times in Chapter 1 with Naomi in the infirmary, I began to hate ghosts in a different sense. ~_~</div>
<div class="p">Multiple endings have been prepared in each chapter, and thus, not like doing a survival horror, in this game no die means no fun! Meanwhile, there are plenty of name tags for you to collect, and it's very fun to read the cause of death for each person (I call it autopsy).</div>
<div class="p">The sound effects were well made and realistic. There are a lot of great and exciting BGMs as well (although for most of times followed by a tragedy). Another delicious part is, since the PSP release, all dialogues have been voiced, with lots of big seiyuu names.</div>
<div class="p">Regardless the above fun things you can do, the system isn't yet that great. No event skip, which is a pain while re-playing; the character's walking (running) speed is too slow; the ending list only lists how many you've obtained, but doesn't tell you what they are; and seems there're quite a lot of bugs, although I haven't seen any.</div>
<div class="p">Overall, it's a great horror game that makes you enjoying different ways of death (the main story is serious). But my strongest impressions in this game are off from the main plot: (1) extra story 1 and, (2) the eerie laugh of the antique doll.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="04">Ar Tonelico</h4>
<div class="p"><a href="http://gustwiki.com/ar-tonelico/wiki/83.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; グラスノ結晶</a></div>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/artonelico1.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">The percussion from the opening song was pretty impressive -- I knew it long before the actual game play!! As a game I knew through hymmnos, the most fun thing during the game play was to locate in which scene each hymmnos was used. Unlike Silent Hill or Biohazard, the turn based battle system was very comfortable and never stressful (back to that time I didn't really understand the difference between horror and RPG).</div>
<div class="p">The story is okay, just like what you'd expect from most other similar games. Although there are a few choices that affect which heroine you will go with in the second half, it's not really a big deal since <s>there're youtube videos ready for people who're lazy to re-play</s> there is literally only one ending, with some minor differences according to whose route you're in. Yet all the three heroines lacks certain attraction: Orica is too negative, Misya's character isn't of my type, and Shureria's existence in the party is as thin as the air.</div>
<div class="p">The power-up system through different crystals is interesting; song magic can be powered up as well through crystals. In my case I found a detailed guide so it didn't take much time to get those I want. But after becoming too strong, everything was like a fast kill and even fighting Kanade-chan or the final boss wasn't fun at all.</div>
<div class="p">However, the dive system is the most boring part across the whole series. It's nothing but similar to a visual novel, and it doesn't really change the story -- You aren't doing the flags and thus "change" the heroines in various ways. Anyone can clear them without reading the text. If not for the new magic, I won't do them at all.</div>
<div class="p">Finally, although it goes with the world setting, I still think it's a stupid idea to link song magic/etc. to computer related concepts.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="05">SILENT HILL</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/silenthill1.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">There's no need to comment on this game too much. Every one knows it, and every one loves it! I'm still scared even during my 5th round play (because my playing skill is too bad)!</div>
<div class="p">This series introduced another parallel-ish world known as "otherworld". The story happens between the normal world and otherworld. To decipher or interpret each single detail in the otherworld would be another type of fun other than the game play.</div>
<div class="p">Monsters are everywhere, and they look (and sound) unpleasant. While you have a few different firearms, you can also find various beating (?) weapons to balance the lack of ammo; among them is the symbolic mark of Silent Hill, the pipe! Then about the riddles, here in Silent Hill, riddles have become so hard and may take very long to solve, in my case, the one in the music room was my nightmare.</div>
<div class="p">On the PS hardware, the graphic looks coarse, but it makes the environment darker and creepier. Instead of individual sound effects, they are kind of merged into the game's soundtracks, and thus it may be disappointing if solely listening to the soundtracks by themselves. Regardless, in game these tracks worked just superb. While among these full-of-noise background music pieces, a few stand out and then shine forever: the world-famous main theme "Silent Hill", Lisa's theme, the different ending themes, and "Silent Hill (Otherside)".</div>
<div class="p">So overall, this game is a must-play unless you can't do horror. If really being picky, the drawback of it could be the frequent change of the camera-angle, as well as the big view-change when you press R2 -- I tended to get a slight motion-sickness while doing it, though it's possible to avoid by moving my sight away from the screen.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="06">Ar Tonelico 2</h4>
<div class="p"><a href="http://gustwiki.com/ar-tonelico2/wiki/154.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; the-most-boring ダイバーズセラピ</a></div>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/artonelico2.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">The graphics changed so much as well that I even think they are ugly -- basically everything except the 2D drawings. Otherwise, A.T.2 is very good in terms of the story, character depiction and of course, the hymmnos.</div>
<div class="p">The battle system is completely different from the simple turn-based A.T.1 fights. In the party you can have two magic chanters along with two regular fighters. By pushing different buttons you can control the fighters' skills, as well as the "evolution" of the song magic; and when two chanters' waves overlap, you can then use synchro-magic, which is much stronger and visually appealing. I remember while fighting high level IPD's I mostly stuck to Croche's pinky magic girl synchro-magic (forgot the name though) just because I loved the animation~</div>
<div class="p">As a way of power-up, you use IPD girls instead of crystals and thus you have to find them around the world and then talk to them in order to cure them... orz Although as a final goal that to complete the 100 people choir for Croche's Replekia, you can't avoid this, it's nothing but tiresome to do the cure! So I went to find another online guide to save some time.</div>
<div class="p">Surprising the story is way beyond average. The depiction between <s>the yuri-sisters</s> Luca and Croche is smooth and the psychological description is detailed rather realistic; quite a lot of events are related to A.T.1 and thus make previous players happy. Regardless, the biggest impact to is probably that the final boss in A.T.1 now becomes one of the main heroines! Guess most people who've done A.T.1 won't refuse to go into her route without too much hesitation. However, in A.T.2, to enter a heroine's route you need to go beyond cosmosphere lv.5, and you can choose only one heroine per round of play. It's extremely annoying here, because A.T.2 has NO way to carry on your clear data to next round. Either to wait until the final moment and obtain all endings, or do this game multiple times from a rather low level and enjoy the new song magic as you go. I confess that I wasn't patient enough. After seeing what's happening at the end (with Jakuri), I gave up obtaining other endings -- tired.</div>
<div class="p">Overall, this is a good game even for people who are not interested in hymmnos (even I enjoyed Jakuri's cosmosphere lv1-5).</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="07">Ar Tonelico 3</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/artonelico3.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">The last game in this series, which is also the wrost one -- to some people it may be the best one though.</div>
<div class="p">The story is too absurd, for lots of times I felt I was watching a cheap soap opear, or doing a GAL instead of a RPG, and the dive parts is making me angry again. On PS3, the 3D models look cheap and some motions look weird, although the 2D drawings are no-doubt pretty. The overall quality of both the BGMs and hymmnos decreased quite a lot, in game the BGMs sounded okay, but never like previous A.T. games that made me having the desire to listen individually; especially the battle BGMs, plainly noisy. As of the hymmnos, I love the super combination of KOKIA + Akiko + Yoko + Haruka, but the rest "hymmnos" don't like how a hymmnos is supposed to be. I know the staff wanted to try something new, but here I don't mind just being conservative.</div>
<div class="p">Again I really hate the idea that taking off the cloth makes the magic chanter stronger. Therefore my favourite female characters in A.T.3 are only Tilia and (the blue) Harvestasya.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="08">SILENT HILL 3</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/silenthill3.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">As I've heard Silent Hill 3 is connected to Silent Hill, I skipped Silent Hill 2 and went for this first. However, until I went to the otherworld of the office building and heard the name "Harry", I didn't see where is the connection. Because the heroine is Heather, not Cheryl. But soon as I left the office building and went back home, what waited me was another shocking event.</div>
<div class="p">I want to use my katana to slash at the staff, who got Harry downed! Due to that event I was depressed for a week -- you know, Harry is has left too much impression in our heart! °A°</div>
<div class="p">On the other hand, to chase what behind of those "evil" characters is fun; I enjoy revealing such back stories, which is an important aspect for horror games. And as I played, I got a complicated feeling toward Vincent.. ^^;</div>
<div class="p">Since that's Silent Hill, every one is obligated to talk about the otherworld. SH3's otherworld is especially astonishing (the hospital!!). The graphic is so distracting. I clearly remember that I just stood in the front of the blood stained small altar table in the hospital, after having a hunch of going down there will be the boss waiting for me. I like such feeling though, but people who're weak on gore elements, it may be a huge pain. The sound effect is also realistic and creepy, sometimes things may not be that scary if without these sounds (not to mention Kenji Kawaii was contributing to the sound effect!).</div>
<div class="p">Back to that time, I didn't trust my skill at all, so I chose easy mode, and the battle wasn't really a problem (except some death-traps). But to make the game play of more fun, I turned on hard for the riddles and they could really make me cry. I just remember I was forced to do some research on Shakespeare, think about how to correlate a person's face to the 10-key number pad, and wandering in the morgue with poems of birds...</div>
<div class="p">However, the endings are too few compared to others, and to me, I refuse to get the "possessed" ending, because I like Douglas. orz</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="09">BIOHAZARD</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/biohazard1.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">Notice that here I'm NOT talking about the remake, nor the 2014 HD remaster!</div>
<div class="p">Not need to say much, every survival horror gamer should (at least) know this game. Since I did Silent Hill earlier than this, I tend to compare these two.</div>
<div class="p">First, the visual impression. Not like SH's monotone + noise, Biohazard's world is quite colourful. Having less disrupting sound effects, there is more music flowing in the back. Yet it doesn't mean it's hot terrifying. Music indeed does a good job. During my first time play, even before Chris meet Rebecca, the mansion is just so creepy and I didn't want to really move around the save room.</div>
<div class="p">The game has two sides featuring Chris and Jill. Chirs = tougher, can carry 6 items at max, partner is Rebecca who will help him playing the piano or make the potion, and, Jill = weaker, can carry 8 items at max, partner is Barry who may save Jill from falling into death trap, randomly, give her ammo, or lead her to the bad end. But don't be fooled by the description text: Jill doesn't mean easy, her HP is too low so she was actually harder in my case! However, this separation is not explaining the other's side = we're playing in parallel worlds! ... Nonetheless who you choose, hunters appearing in the second half was a pain.</div>
<div class="p">Then, after clear, the ending theme song is so amazing!</div>
<div class="p">No wonder why this game marks the genre of survival horror. Horror fans shall do the earliest Play Station version if there's a chance!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="10">Corpse Party -Book of Shadows-*</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/corpse_party_bookshadow.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">I've heard that Taiwan fans ever gave it a nickname: survival records of the Bento-team, whereas "bento" means an important character who dies soon.</div>
<div class="p">You can think this is another story, a spin-off<s>, another world-line</s>... whatever. Seems not that interesting to people who only watch the main story. But once you unlock all endings for all chapters, you'll get to the hidden chapter, which is linked to the world right after CP's main story, which then leads to a future game "blood drive" (so confusing here, as the hidden chapter's title is also "blood drive").</div>
<div class="p">So basically, you spend money and time in this game, only for the hidden chapter (although that's good, quite scary!).</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="11">SILENT HILL 2</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/silenthill2.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p"><span class="bigger"><b>The best game ever!</b></span> and need not to say that everyone knows the world-famous Pyramid Head, regardless whether they play the game.</div>
<div class="p">As a game, I mean a horror game, it has to be scary. SH2 doesn't have a crazy place like the SH3 hospital, while it has quite a lot of scary points: 1, the roof of hospital, where you encounter Pyramid and then falls down; 2, the "bug room" near the prison; 3, Pyramid appears silently when you and Maria are walking toward the elevator; 4, the elevator that doesn't allow even one more piece of photo; 5, the endless stairs; etc... -- I'd say nurses are the cutest creatures across the game!</div>
<div class="p">The system has been improved a lot: just follow James' sight will lead you to get items that are hard to see, and the map can now be switched between areas without actually going to that place. Another thing is the camera angle, although keeps changing in game, seems have less bad effect on people who have motion sickness. Riddles from the hard mode, on the other hand, are more lenient than SH3's hard mode, and I even learned how to open a dial lock! xD</div>
<div class="p">Now, the music and story, which are of the most impressive. SH2's OST is more melodic compared to SH1. "Theme of Laura" is addictive (which later was integrated into the song "Waiting for you") -- although I don't like that little girl. Since the very beginning, the gloomy music with narration bring players into a sad world full of negative force (?). As we move with James, we meet a few others and discover more messages in this ruined town. Everyone here has their own story, and they seem to be not in the same world. Toward the end, the riddle will finally be solved. Silent Hill is a mysterious place, no wonder Mary wants come back again. There are multiple endings depending on how James takes action in game, (Shamefully I only got the "Leave" end so far due to my poor playing skill.) yet I'm really looking forward the UFO/Dog ends.</div>
<div class="p">There is also another mini (?) game episode featuring Maria is available in some editions. Although how it ends is not yet enough to be connected to the main episode smoothly, this is quite scary and well made as well. So if you haven't played this game, get the edition have this episode (PS3's HD recommended!)</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="12">学校であった怖い話S / Gakkou de atta Kowai Hanashi S</h4>
<div class="p"><a href="http://www.akkan.sakura.ne.jp/gakkou/scenario-gs.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; シナリオ一覧表</a></div>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/gakkouwa.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">A text based horror game. It doesn't sound to be that scary to me at first since I don't need to actually fight monsters, but it uses sound effects and <s>weirdly looking</s> images to scare players. So I do admit it's a horror game, although the degree of horror is faint (don't forget I'm a Silent Hill survivor!).</div>
<div class="p">Regardless, each story is yet fun to read. Some are based on well-known ghost stories that give you a familiar feeling. The different order of story tellers give you different stories and different endings. Under specific orders, you can also get hidden stories, which is smart (and tough if with no walkthrough chart).</div>
<div class="p">However, forcefully, I don't like Akemi since she brings us players so many death traps! And because this game was developed very early, you can't save right before each branch selection, which is a pain if you really want to browse across all variations of the story or just a minor expression.</div>
<div class="p">P.S. I think I got an uneasy feeling with Akeme's "disappeared paint" story with its hidden plot. xDD;;</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="13">SIREN New Translation*</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/siren_nt.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">My SIREN series began with this one, perhaps it was because I've heard about people saying this name for so many times. My first impression was this game was like Ju-on, in with contains many episodes of different characters. As a game, this is rare, and indeed interesting. You can see how character interact and thus you'll understand a specific episode you've played before. But also due to the multi-character style, it can be sometimes hard to connect everything as a whole.</div>
<div class="p">You might not care about the story since it's not a movie. As a horror game, it has "nice" graphic and realistic sound effects. Characters are not heavily armed like the S.T.A.R.S. members as they are merely regular visitors to this isolated village. Some may pick up farming tools as the weapon, but some don't have any weapon at all. This increases the tension during the game play -- in this sense, Bella's episodes are the true horror while others are more like weakened action fighting game?</div>
<div class="p">And here, I just can't not mentioning the theme song. It does rock!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="14">SIREN</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/siren1.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">Continued from my SIREN NT experience, I was curious about how the original SIREN feels like. So the story of NT is based on this game. With much more characters, SIREN's plot is more complicated. Because it's a PS2 game, the graphic looks more coarse. Everything was just so dark that for lots of times I got lost (also thanks to their map system that doesn't indicate where you are!).</div>
<div class="p">Because there is the second scenario, which can only be unlocked after stepping onto specific flags. Without a good guide, it can be like in hell to unlock all of them and you may have to play the same scenario again and again. SIREN staff is so much more cruel than CAPCOM staff! I doubt it makes people want to do a second round after clear. (At least give us Suda Kyouya's laser gun!! No one cares about reality after one time clear, really!)</div>
<div>It is an excellent horror game, but to myself, I can't tell whether or not I like it. I'm not good at stealth games at all, and I have no sense of direction -- the game beats me at both aspects. orz</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="15">SIREN 2</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/siren2.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">Still lots of characters and scenarios, but this time the game system is improved and made players happier. "To do what so you can unlock someone's second scenario", such text is displayed in game so it is much easier to unlock even at the first time. While a few characters can't fight at all, the ones who can are able to take two different weapons (go Yagura go!!), and punching with hands is enabled (although it won't work for most of times)! The map now can be viewed by floor or area, and your current location is also displayed. Right, this is finally right. We are playing games, not training our sense of direction!</div>
<div class="p">However, the plot is still "brutal", especially after seeing Yorito's end. "How come I only deserve such an end even though I tried hardest among all characters?!!" Abe's end is sad with warmth, and Itsuki's end is... just normal? xD During the play, I really felt bad when seeing Fujita and Misawa's ends. Okay, I get it, SIREN staff is made by a group of devils.</div>
<div class="p">My last little wish, please let Suda Kyouya meet Yorito and let the two go duet. Kyouya has the strong laser gun, while Yorito has his unlimited(?) machine gun!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="16">青鬼 / Ao Oni</h4>
<div class="p"><a href="http://mygames888.info/aooni.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Official Site</a></div>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/aooni.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">A simple yet fun free game. There are versions 1, 3.1, 3.6 and 6 so far. The plot is simple, to leave the locked house, while escaping from the blue demon (ao-oni) who shows up randomly.</div>
<div class="p">I've played all these versions. The map is getting bigger and there are more riddles for you as the dessert. Because the blue demon appears randomly, you won't be prepared and thus the game can be played over and over without getting bored. In version 6, a mini game "south park" is available, but is in fact more bloody. It also allows you to change Hiroshi's name, by entering some certain names, some elements in game will be changed as a return.</div>
<div class="p">This game is very popular among people who stream their game play. Seeing different people getting nervous / going out of control / screaming like mad is another kind of fun brought by this game.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="17">魔女の家 / Majo no Ie</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/majoie.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">The biggest entertainment (?) of this game is to see its countless death traps! No, I shouldn't say that... but I do believe the author made this game and had a heart for people getting trapped.</div>
<div class="p">The goal is to, like most other horror games, leave the mansion. During the game play, you'll get a chance to reveal the truth hidden behind. There's no random things chase you, so after one time clear, you may want to challenge no save, which will bring you some more shocking information (I tried and failed miserably). There are two endings can be obtained after first (normal end) and second (true end) clear. However, while the normal end was still acceptable, after seeing the true end made me weirdly upset and decided not to touch this game any more. I can't say I don't like it as a game. It's made of high quality. I just don't like the hidden truth. -- What a paradox!</div>

<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/ib.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">This is perhaps the best free game I've played so far (even though, there're only 3 in total including this...). The stage setup is good (a museum, quiet, and may be full of weird things), the story flow is good (more importantly, reasonable), and the flagging isn't tiresome so you can easily get all its endings (the true end makes me feel good, while one of Mary's endings reminds me Corpse Party.. xD).</div>
<div class="p">The game itself isn't hard, although with a few death traps. I got addicted and eventually collected all endings and artworks. Everything was finished too soon, but at least I did have a good time with it.</div>
<div class="p">I actually knew this game from Haruka Shimotsuki's winter release in 2012, go try those songs as well if you like this game!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="19">Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/callcthulhu.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">I have no idea about the original horror stories. Just because someone recommended me this game as a horror I gave it a try.</div>
<div class="p">The opening episode was okay as there's no any kind of fight. Yet, walking in the house was a bit scary. But rather than saying I was scared by the atmosphere or so, it was actually the 1st person view did the job -- I couldn't see myself, and didn't know what's going on, which made me feeling anxious. Then quickly, nothing was hard in chapter 1 and 2. I think I cleared them fairly quick. As the story went, the silent town (whose name I forgot) was such a good place to trigger any hidden feeling of fear in my heart. The local people looked "funny" and a few steath actions brought a good taste of tension. Although I want to point out that, as a detective, why he doesn't even have a pipe as the weapon -- or at least bring a lighter? orz</div>
<div class="p">However, then the problem came. I indeed have the intention to continue this game, but after the first time of about 1 hour of play, I wasn't feeling well. In fact it took me more than 3 hours to recover... and then I learned that I have serious motion sickness in first person view games! °A° It's a shame, but I had to drop this game forever.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="20">BIOHAZARD 2</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/biohazard2.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">Someone ever poked in that "Two" in the title call sounds like "chyuu", so Biohazard 2 can be shortened as "Bio-chyuu" =&gt; "bite you"... xD;</div>
<div class="p">There are in total 2 main scenarios: Leon A + Claire B, and Claire A + Leon B. They are like parallel world lines, yet seems it's never (?) announced which one is the official -- personally I prefer Claire A + Leon B. Regardless, I've played all these for not less than 10 times. Biohazard 2 is so addictive. The harsh 6-slot-only-carry-on-item-system is gone forever, the character parameters are well balanced, and there're plenty of items that sometimes you may even not want to pick up.</div>
<div class="p">Both Claire and Leon have relationship to Biohazard 1, and we will meet Sherry in Claire's route and Ada in Leon's, while both will appear in following games. So that's how Biohazard began to connect all characters across the entire series. This is so smart, as people like me would want to do Biohazard 4 + even it's not a survival horror, simply because they want to see the after story of the characters they know in earlier games. By fulfilling some requirements, there will be EX battles and the 4th survivor becoming available. They are focusing on the fighting system mainly. But although I managed to clear level 1 and 2, level 3 is so hard and is still in pending. As of Hunk and Tofu's escape, I couldn't clear at all. Maybe someday I should try using unlimited ammo (but what about Tofu!).</div>
<div class="p">Zombies now come in batch! And the knife had become so weak that you should dump into the item box as soon as possible. Fortunately there's no hunter in Bio2. Although lickers are strong too, they are blind and you'll be mostly safe if not running. The first stage of G may hurt a bit, and Claire's regular grenade rounds are a bit tricky to use. At this point, I've played Biohazard 1-5 + veronica, and I can only do a no-save run in this one, because Biohazard 2 has no hunters. Maybe Biohazard can be a good introduction for survival game beginners.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="21">BIOHAZARD 3: Last Escape</h4>
<div class="p"><a href="http://www.syumimania.com/bio3/solve-a-device.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; 仕掛け解答集</a></div>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/biohazard3.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">In Biohazard, I always choose to play with Chris because it's of more challenge, so to me, it was like my first time really spending time with Jill (she looks better in the STARS uniform in my opinion), and the other playable character is Carlos, a strong-looking (not that tough though) man. He's with his team members Nicolai and Mikhail. In the mercenaries, these three are the shinning stars (although I'm keeping dying due to my bad skill even with Mikhail).</div>
<div class="p">This time, you don't have to press O while climbing the stairs, so it's easier to choose a position during fighting, but similarly, zombies now can use the stairs as well... °A° The gun powder system and ice-beam are introduced as the strongest ammo (overcomes magnum, at least more practical). Monsters at some areas are random, so you don't know you'll be facing a group of zombies or hunters (I simply wished zombies every time ^^;). The riddles, they're not getting harder, but more annoying so after the first round, I always keep the memo of all correct answers beside.</div>
<div class="p">The second tension in this game (while the first is always the hunters) is Nemesis. Not like any type of tyrant in previous games, he is quick, and can even use a rocket launcher. Skilled players always choose to kill him since you can get rewards similar to tyrant in Bio2, but I always choose run as I know I have no chance to beat him (under heavy mode) and don't want to waste my ammo. The final fight is fun, in which you control an ultimate laser (?) canon -- make sure you leave its firing spot before it launches! Two endings are available depending the last selection, and by selecting "jumping down" we get a chance to meet Barry. And after clear, you can unlock 8 or so after stories of characters in Biohazard series, mini game the mercenaries, and costumes (including the STARS uniform). Unlimited weapons are purchased through points earned in the mercenaries, which means I should give up.</div>
<div class="p">At the 4th round, I finally realised the real use of rocket launcher is to destroy Nicolai's helicopter. orz</div>
<div class="p">P.S. The ending movie is impressive (but in Barry's end, Carlos' existence is miserably gone completely).</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="23">Clock Tower 2 &amp; Clock Tower*</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/clock_tower.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">I did Clock Tower 2 first. With no background knowledge from Clock Tower, I was shocked after knowing Jennifer is only 15 (I won't doubt if they say she is 30)! Somehow, the fact that I indeed cleared this game doesn't look like real on my mind. This game relies on flagging, which I don't like at all. I'm the type to click on everything so it's so easy for me to fall into a death trap. Moreover, the controlling is just terrible (the main reason made me annoyed). I soon got bored during the game play and simply found some walkthrough and made a quick clear -- I never do it for other horror games during the first round.</div>
<div class="p">Later on, I have Clock Tower a brief try. Sadly, after finishing it once, I had no more desire to continue getting all its endings. I just can't do flagging games. The very first Clock Tower is even worse in terms of the character control. She moves so slow, and it doesn't make sense that her HP drops when she gets tired (why in a game things are so real that the player has to let her take a rest by wasting some time?). Plus, although the background looks interesting: a scissor man appears and murders people. In game there's no enough information at all to make players discover the truth. You just unfortunately get trapped there and needs to escape. Fine, in real world that's everything you need to do, but again, it's a game, we want to know more so we can be of more desire to play.</div>
<div class="p">Overall, with a sort of interesting background, the actual game isn't good in terms of both system and supporting information. Not recommended for people who don't like flagging. But if you just want to feel being chased and find a way to survive, it may be a good choice.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="26">SILENT HILL 4: The Room</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/silenthill4.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">Not like walking around the town of Silent Hill, you go between the dream and the reality. Informative messages are sometimes delivered under your locked front door to help you reveal the world of SH4 (yet too bad I didn't get the entire story until read some websites after 1st time clear). The world of dream (Silent Hill) is still dark as usual, and this time, the long-haired gunman even increases the tension a lot. For the game system, it's now like biohazard with an item box and a limited number of carry on item, while in case of bullets is 10 per slot! orz. Fortunately, from the every-Silent-Hill-character-should-have-one pipe to the rusted axe, such weapons are used more frequently. The classic health drinks are much fewer in the first half of game, as going back to the reality can fully restore your HP. In the second half, the confined room begins to be invaded by "someone's nightmare", and you have to use proper items to make you staying safe (like what Ayumi does in Corpse Party). Finally, depending on your in game action, the destiny of both of you and your confined room will be affected.</div>
<div class="p">Sound effects are just like all other SH games, so real and a headphone is highly recommended (ideally should play at night). Akira's music is also awesome, although quite a lot of tracks from the OST are not actually used in game. I've listened to the OST long before I did the game, so during the play, I was often excited about a familiar melody flowing in back (I wished they could have the cutscene with "Tender Sugar rearranged" longer!).</div>
<div class="p">For the drawbacks, the biggest one would be the lack of a radio control. SH4 has only the 2D styled control, and I got confused for a lot of times, when the camera angle is in the opposite orientation of my own view. The other is, the otherworld isn't rendered enough -- I want to go to the otherworld of the hospital!! °A°</div>
<div class="p">Although a lot said SH4 is the dark history across the main series, it's not really like that bad. The depressed feeling after clear is the same as all SH1, 2 and 3!</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="28">Shadow Hearts</h4>
<div class="p"><a href="http://www.geocities.jp/sky_peace000/sd_1/index.htm" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; シャドウハーツ１攻略</a></div>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/shadowhearts1.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">Regardless the release date and platform, Shadow Heart series is my top 1 RPG (just like Silent Hill is my top 1 horror) and its position won't be changed. The weapon system isn't complicated, which is good as a reason I don't usually like RPGs is I don't like to take time worrying about the gears. It has a unique battle system using judgement rings, so if you play with eyes closed (like other turn based RPGs), you won't have chance to win at all, and the rings can be customised at a limited range.</div>
<div class="p">Characters are all have their strong personalities and it's hard to decide the party members for me all the time (and I want to complain that non-battle members can't get any exp!). The skills are fun (especially that a character's most skills all have the same spell). The story is very good and impressive, it's mainly in a fantastic style blended into a near-realistic background; and throughout the game, (both good and evil) people keep dying! °A° -- The situation is keeping changing as well, making the story rich and dramatic (and thus brings a big shock into Shadow Hearts 2, regarding the final boss). Fortunately, the sense of humour across all SH series is marvellous so that balances the kind of dark and depressing atmosphere.</div>
<div class="p">I won't use more text, but the music of this game is just excellent, especially the final boss' BGM. I indeed spent a long time to fight the final boss, but because of "Imbroglio" it was the best fight ever among all battles in game.</div>
<div class="p">While to get the good ending along with to unlock some hidden dungeions can be hard for people who don't have a guide (like me). I did learn my lesson from it, always have a guide that don't contain spoiler so you can enjoy gaming and save your time at the same time.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="29">Shadow Hearts II</h4>
<div class="p"><a href="http://www.geocities.jp/sky_peace000/sd_2/index.htm" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; シャドウハーツ２攻略</a></div>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/shadowhearts2.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">After getting both endings of Shadow Hearts, I couldn't wait and thus started SH2. Music is excellent as usual, more cutscene movies are included, and the character models look more vivid. A lot have been improved in terms of the game system: Customisation of judgement rings is more of freedom, the battle system has added combo and combo magic, characters can use various magic through equipping magic crests, and the best is, the type of ending is determined at the very end, while hidden dungeons can be unlocked at almost any time. I specially enjoyed fighting the 30k HP Seven-Lucky-God boss (after spending an hour!).</div>
<div class="p">The story follows SH1's "bad ending", which made me unhappy at the very beginning, but after seeing its good ending, everything began to make sense<s>: it's all about switching the world lines, so you become the experienced and then can take actions to avoid the bad ending in SH1 to occur!</s> So after Alice's death, the ambience is even darker in SH2. But for a lot of more times, the game is full of laughing spots, thanks to the marvellous sense of humour (especially Joachim)! There's also a chance to "rename" a character regardless SH2 doesn't support this really.</div>
<div class="p">However, I'd want to see more about Kato's side. There're several scenes involving his actions but they don't make a reasonable flow, especially toward the second half of story. And what he has done made the game more SF-ish (or biohazard ish...)</div>
<div class="p">P.S. I was excited right after hearing Nicolai's voice! As an evil side character, I'm strongly fond of him! xD</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="30">BIOHAZARD: Code Veronica</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/veronica.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">The most unfriendly Biohazard I've done compared to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. But I'm really happy to see both Claire and Chris being in action. It has two main stages with several sub-areas, a small tropic (?) island and the Antarctic (although just by looking at the screen I feel cold because of their clothing...), which made the entire game very long.</div>
<div class="p">So why I say it's unfriendly: Respawn zombies appear since the very early stage, items are so well hidden within the shadows, riddles themselves are not hard but some require special manner and some are associated with death traps, character change without a sign so you lose your weapons, and the annoying poisonous moths and hunters the BOW star (now with a poisonous claw!), etc...</div>
<div class="p">Moreover, need not to mention the boss fight on the roof. I retried for at least two hours! I had a hunch that I should hit his heart, but the rifle wasn't so easy to use, and the blizzard was making things worse. I also didn't know how many times I fell off even before I find a good position to shoot. It was just hard. To break the crystal ball was hard as well, in another sense (I kept retrying for another hour. orz).</div>
<div class="p">Yet all these made the game harsh but very fun. Toward the end I was laughing how this game's title is actually the password -- did the staff do it on purpose for people who don't know how to spell veronica? As veronica was written in Katagana in game. As of Steve's death. I wasn't surprised because I was spoiled earlier from its OST. -_-''</div>
<div class="p">As Biohazard's habit, you can still get unlimited rocket launcher as a bonus weapon. But I don't think I can ever get it. Not like others require fewer saves, veronica asks for no save!! Here we have hunters, so I can't do no save! CAPCOM the devil! &gt;_&lt;</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="31">BIOHAZARD 4</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/biohazard4.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">Just let me say at the very beginning: Leon is such a handsome!!</div>
<div class="p">Originally I never imagined me doing Bio4, as it's more like an action rather than a survival horror. But, I eventually couldn't say no after seeing Leon's face. The result wasn't bad, I managed to fight through and really love this game.</div>
<div class="p">I was actually surprised I didn't have too much trouble doing gun fire without the auto-aiming system in previous biohazard, and I liked to talk to the weapon merchant so much. I'd say I'd like to stay with him much more than stay with Ashley. While for most of times my game play was going smoothly, I did spend quite a lot of fight with some boss fights (the battles with the little man who is 20 years old and Krauser took me 2 hours or so!). Plus, for lots of scenes, there are buttons pop up and you have to push them in time. I just can't do it well. I remember I retried about 10 times during the conversation with Krauser! Just let us watch the movie, please! ^^;</div>
<div class="p">Meanwhile, the hidden heroine is of course Ada. Her scenarios after the main game clear is also good just like the side B in Biohazard 2. But again, like what happened in all other biohazard games, I just can't do these mercenaries games well.</div>
<div class="p">And I need to find a time to challenge the hard mode, and also to complete the bottle cap collection. :3</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="32">BIOHAZARD 5</h4>
<div class="p"><a href="game-kouryaku.info/biohazard5/bsaa.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; BSAAエンブレム</a></div>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/biohazard5.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">The first edition of Bio5 isn't worth buying. The alternative edition is the one you should buy. The latter comes with two additional episodes, with one brings you back to the familiar world of survival horror! The main game is, however, like Bio4, nothing related to horror any more.</div>
<div class="p">And also like Bio4, I did Bio5 because Chris and Jill are there (Well done, Capcom, you indeed make non action game players doing an action game). If you are playing alone, your partner will be controlled by AI. But this is even worse than rescue Ashley in Bio4. The AI is never good to manage: uses ammo too quick (although that's all accurate), uses herbs at a stupid moment, doesn't come when you call and can't be ordered to follow your battle tactics, or block your shooting sight... regardless, it's fun if two people playing at the same time though (try to turn on friendly fire).</div>
<div class="p">The plot is okay, but during the playing, I didn't feel too much involved in the story, mainly due to that you can take action while the conversation is going, so you tend to focus on your stuff and neglect what they're saying. The difficulty is increased compared to Bio4, as you can now change weapons by pressing arrow keys (which is hard for me as I'm used to use it to move). Also, the live command (or whatever it's called) are so small to see and so short to let me react. ~_~</div>
<div class="p">In my opinion, since Bio4, this series is the best for you when you want to stab someone yet you know you can't do it for real -- my favourite enemy is the Gatling fatty, it's fun to see his hat falling off when you shoot properly~</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="33">Atelier Rorona (remake)</h4>
<div class="p"><a href="http://andraste.info/g/atelier_rorona/03_c01_chart_main_story.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; 本編・全エンディング完全攻略チャート</a></div>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/rorona.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">I'm glad I bought the remake version as the original graphic looks bad <s>yet the true reason I bought this game was it was on sale with a 1/3 discount</s>. And my first expression, why she keeps jumping while moving?! -- the habit acquired from all the horror games I've done.</div>
<div class="p">As of the gaming experience, it was good. No tension at all. Literally nothing -- Shadow Hearts has its judgement rings; I feel like one can clear this game without thinking too much -- well, RPGs aren't supposed to give you tension like survival horrors. More importantly, the graphic is so cute, and it comes with full voice, while Rorona's cast voice is the one who voiced Iriya in Fate Stay Night! But the flagging is a bit annoying. After the first time clear, even after getting a complete guide about how to flag for all endings, it's still tiresome, especially the lv50 requirement -- why I have to force myself levelling up, including a tsundere character, which is not of my type at all!</div>
<div class="p">The remake version includes an additional year to play. Literally no game over, and weapons obtained can be carried to the next main round. Sounds like a free bonus, but the battles become extremely harsh unless you have proper gears. Currently I got stuck at the boss who can restore 5k HP when it drops down to half, hope I can explore all dungeons in the 2nd round (I don't think I have enough guts to do a RPG for many rounds).</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="34">Atelier Totori</h4>

<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/totori.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">Bought together with Rorona (but no Meruru because I ever saw someone playing it and I don't like her). As the second game of this series, it will be more fun to do it after playing Rorona. But since my Rorona is the "advanced edition", here I feel the game system isn't that good. Nonetheless, the graphic is cute as usual, and in this sense I have no complaints at all of playing it!</div>
<div class="p">Overall, the game play itself has no difference from Rorona, and since you can carry on your weapons to the next round, it's not that hard to aim for an all-ending collection. Yet the flagging is tiresome, and again, I simply hate the lv50 requirement. Why I have to include another tsundere in my party and make her lv50? GUST loves tsundere that much?!</div>
<div class="p">P.S. Totori in Rorona's additional year is super cute that made me put her in the party without thinking at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="35">Shadow Hearts: From the New World</h4>

<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/shadowhearts3.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">I was surprised that the Akiko-sings-Mozart track was used quite early, without specific meanings -- perhaps Akiko did that aria just for fun because the stage is in a ruined theatre. Any way, I was glad to meet Roger Bacon here again (with the familiar custom naming screen)!</div>
<div class="p">Jonny is so cute! Although I like girls, I won't mind if I ever had a younger brother like him! He's never out of the party, not only for snaps, but also because his high MP making him a good magic warrior. Natan is a tough guy (of my type) so he's in my party. And his skills are all so cool. I don't know much about guns, although in game it says he uses handguns, to me they look like magnum! (at first I thought he's of the physical attack type, but toward the end I noticed his S-Atk and MP are even high than Jonny's.) Frank is a nice and funny guy. He's in my party all the way even solely because I like want to hear his voice when he uses skills. "ME ni Pawaa wo--" xDD and Ricardo, the last fixed member in my party. With a handsome appearance and a high Atk, guess no one would reject him. His guitar is charming as well!</div>
<div class="p">Whereas, that was a shame I don't like Shanaia, the one who has fusion monsters. As of Nyanko-sensei, I wanted to let her in but other male characters eclipsed her existence. Finally, the vampire girl isn't of my type at all, so she was out of my consideration.</div>
<div class="p">This time, the combo system is becoming more demanding on the stock gauge. At first I didn't know it and wondered why it didn't let me to do a full party combo or use the combo-magic (obviously I never read the in game turtorials...). The magic, on the other hand, become easier to choose. Just select the ones you need and put them onto a chart. Much better than the previous system, in which one crest has 4 different skills so you may get lost while looking for a specific skill.</div>
<div class="p">As usual, I played with a detailed walkthrough, so I won't be wasting too much time in the maze-like dungeons and die due to the lack of proper preparation. The story, less impressive compared to SH1 and SH2, is good, although I'm not that happy with the "good end", and it's a bit complicated to describe.</div>
<div class="p">Since it's the last game in Shadow Heart series, let me have a final conclusion: Shadow Hearts males are way too impressive that the females are out of my attension.</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="37">Atelier Iris</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/iris1.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">No, it's not like the atelier series, it's just a GUST-ish RPG... -__-</div>
<div class="p">But why I dropped playing wasn't because what I just said. It's all the fault of the game system. (1) It's not biohazard, why the hell the maximal number of each item is merely 9?! (2) You've to pay attention to the status of your Mana, you think you're Princess Maker? (3) the random encounter is too frequent and thus annoying; it's almost one battle per 3-5 steps! (4) not only enemies appear frequently due to (3), lots of enemies, especially during the early stages, are way stronger and I felt the as a game it's very unbalanced, (5) the story is unclear and is thus boring.

<div class="p"><a href="http://ryvo2.web.fc2.com/zero/zero.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Walkthrough &amp; Ghost list</a></div>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/zero1.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">It was funny that after clear this game, I read on someone's blog, he says the player has to be super bold in order to play this game alone at night. What? When I was playing, it was always after 23:00, and I was in my room by myself; I DIDN'T think it's that scary, and I was even amused by the looks of many ghosts!</div>
<div class="p">Why was that? Did I become numb after all the way through Silent Hill or Raccoon City? No, I confess that, when I say it's not scary, I mean it's better than the previous two, although some ghost's face indeed made me uncomfortable. However, the graphics in Zero is just beautiful, and the girls are so cute. These served as a balance and reduced the degree of horror, seriously!</div>
<div class="p">To me, my top hatred is the female ghost with her eyes destroyed. She's harder to avoid than Biohazard's licker! The final boss Ms. Kirie was surprisingly easier to fight compared to her.</div>
<div class="p">The ghost list is a big pain if you're aiming for perfection. Frankly, I gave up completing it. I don't think I can make the snap for the woman who falls down to the ground in the inner yard.</div>
<div class="p">Some complaints: 1) the moves of characters are done in a 2D mode yet the camera angle is fixed, so I got confused all the time where I should go, why they just enable radio control which would make things straightforward? 2) I don't know what kind of person Mafuyu is, but I'm mad at him at the end. How come a ghost can be more important than your real sister? If I were Miku and knew what Mafuyu would do, I won't come to look for him at all! lol 3) some spirit photos are just too vague to see what's in there. It's a game, so it won't hurt to make the photos better -- what the staff was thinking about..?</div>

<div class="p">A horror game full of beautiful crimson butter flies -- The second beautiful horror game in the Zero series. While I was confident at its battle system, they had a few improvements so I had to adapt myself again. Overall, these improvements are good, especially that you can use special lens without thinking too much on wasting your stones. Battles are easier compared to Zero, probably because you can get lots of points quickly and use them to enhance your camera.</div>
<div class="p">Like what I said about Zero, this horror game isn't that scary because of this or that. This time, we have Kawasumi Ayako doing Mayu's voice, which even reduces its degree of horror -- I'm just healed by her voice and can forget I'm doing a horror game. Yet I need to point out, I was actually in panic while encountering Sae and being chased in Kiryuu(or is that Tachibana?)'s house. Everything was faded to black and white only, and you can't even been touched by Sae as you'll be killed immediately. The final boss fight (normal mode) is tricky as well, and the path to the closest save point is just too far! Then, the normal ending, is so shocking. I can't say I like Amano Tsukiko and her J-rock style, but I do like this ending theme song with the movie playing together.</div>
<div class="p">Although the non-radio control problem is annoying as usual, I think I shouldn't complain any more because they're not from CAPCOM or KONAMI, and I enjoyed a lot in this kind of "healing horror" (except the endings!).</div>

<div class="p"><a href="http://ryvo2.web.fc2.com/zero/zero3.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Walkthrough &amp; Ghost list</a></div>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/zero3.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">The last Zero released on PlayStation (too bad I'm not planning to get a Wii at all). I was expecting a smooth game play based on my previous experience. But who knows this Zero has the hardest battle system. There are multiple playable characters, which is fine, but the points you earn from each battle are so few and never enough to fully enhance one single camera, the gauge increases in an ultra slow speed and limited the time you can use the special skills. Even worse, while points are shared among characters, items aren't; ghosts appear in groups; they did the same in Zero 2 but in 3 the number is larger, their speed is of course faster, and the space is so narrow. Plus, this time, there are more ghosts just floating above you, so it's very hard to locate them -- Don't say Rei and others are having a nightmare, fighting with these annoying ghosts is nothing but the player's nightmare.</div>
<div class="p">Multiple playable characters, Rei, Miku (long time no see! °w°) and Kei. Miku's camera has a small focus, and Kei's just not good with ghosts (?). Rei's camera is the easiest one, and her flash is helpful, but it's not making the battles easier (so just imagine the other two). Meanwhile, due to the frequent character change, I sometimes got lost in the connection between chapters. Thanks to this, Zero 3's background is the most unclear one to me.</div>
<div class="p">But as a final summary, I'd say I like all the three Zero games. After clear Zero 3, things are all connected, yet I was exhausted during all the battles and doubt I can even complete its mini mission games.</div>
<div class="p"><b>MISSIONS ARE SO HARSH THAT I WANT TO PUNCH THE STAFF ON THE FACE! °A°</b></div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="41">Atelier Iris 2</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/iris2.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">Largely improved since the previous. While still not like of the atelier series, it's pretty good as a normal RPG.</div>
<div class="p">Story this time makes more sense, although at lots of times plot looks weird and you'd be able to guess what's going to happen (the common problem of most RPGs?). The existence of lots of party members are as thin as the air (while that about the little girl Iris isn't enough at all). However, because this game allows to switch party members during the battle, to me, they're only useful when to revive the dead members. Different from Iris 1, the battles are unbelievably easy including the final boss -- if you can't switch party members it would be more fun.</div>
<div class="p">The alchemy system had become very user-friendly. The Mana's status is gone, each item can be hold up to 99, and use-items can be mass produced easily without consume collected materials. It's very convenient, although still pointless: mass production only requires the basic elements, basically nothing changes before and after the mass production, the story isn't affected, the product properties aren't affect, the character's level isn't affected, you just get much more items, and can replenish (at least most of) used elements quickly and easily. Yet to repeat such a round is just a waste of time. Frankly, I don't think it will make any difference even if there's no "alchemy" part at all; it can just be like Ar Tonelico, in which any character can create items with a recipe.</div>
<div class="p">Last complaint, there's no map for each dungeon! °A°</div>
</div>
<div class="gameblock"><h4 id="42">Corpse Party 2 -Dead Patient- [Chapter 1]*</h4>
<span class="cover"><img src="/elem/img/gamecovers/corpse_party2.jpg" /></span>
<div class="p">A horror game that was made in a non-horror manner. If say the original CP's 2D display has a low resolution and thus the pixels can create a distorted impression, CP2's 3D rendering with a higher resolution and the chibi-characters aren't contributing to make the overall view any horror. Some players said it doesn't have full-voice, which was a shame. I'm fine with it, but I do have complaints on the voicing. The cast voice of main girl was a bit overdoing, so were people who did the sounds. I just want to laugh that how come she can start to gasp right after she runs (while on the screen she isn't running that fast)!</div>
<div class="p">It's hard to treat this game independently, especially after seeing Ayumi and someone appearing in the opening. But while wishing this is anothe game about black magic or this sort, the play experience made me feeling nothing more than biohazard. Under Corpse Party's name, yet in game we hardly see a corpse, only those zombies wandering around! At the end of chapter 1 suddenly the number of characters increased and then the chapter ended. How the staff is going to fill the huge leap? I'm not really interested in the story to be honest, but the only reason for me to wait for its following contents will be to see how CP1 and CP2 are linked.</div>
