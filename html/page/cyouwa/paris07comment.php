<i>*Partly translated from KOKIA blog: "Diary in Pairs" section*; entires were around 2007-Jan-25</i></div>

<div class="p">-Part 1-</div>
<div class="p"><b>"Uchuuga..." "so sad so bad"♪</b><br />
Bonjour a tous!! Good evening, everyone!<br />
Although I took much effort to remember some French, I still didn't feel I understand them really. English and Japanese are more adorable. ^_^ I just smiled when I felt in trouble! ?</div>

<div class="p"><b>"Ahiru no Kokoro"♪</b><br />
It was so happy, I quacked more times than other times.</div>

<div class="p"><b>"cocoro"♪</b><br />
Since I've come to France, I sang it with an even deeper "Japanese" heart.</div>

<div class="p"><b>"Yasashiku sareruto Yasashiku nareru Hana"♪</b><br />
In fact, this was the first time I sang it on stage. I was very nervous, yet I liked it while singing.<br />
Such things happen occasionally.<br />
This is a song I enjoy more on live than in recording.</div>

<div class="p"><b>"Futari no Musume"♪</b><br />
Like "cocoro", this song was included in the new album "aigakikoeru", because we wanted to put some songs that people will know they are Japanese-ish immediately.</div>

<div class="p"><b>"why do I sing?"♪</b><br />
It's like the English version of "Utau Hito".</div>

<div class="p"><b>"I believe ~Umi no Soko Kara~"♪</b><br />
This song feels like the bubbles reached the high ceiling, and then disappeared.<br />
The last song of the first part. From the bottom of sea, everything is waiting for this moment.<br />
I hope everything can be led by the spotlight, to the place where light is shining.</div>

<div class="p">-Part 2-<br />
<div class="p"><b>"Nukumori"♪</b><br />
Part 2 began from "put your hands to your heart…" in quietness.<br />
Grandpa, I'm in the endless blessing of being together with lots of people.</div>

<div class="p"><b>"The Colour of Paris"♪</b><br />
I wrote this French song for this concert.<br />
The pronunciation was very difficult; it was so hard to sing it.<br />
But the sound is very beautiful, I think I made the ambience.</div>

<div class="p"><b>"Pink no Zou"♪</b><br />
I made my "trip trip" to India with the pink elephant I got from fans at an early in-store event<br />
Even though I didn't say anything, it was so nice that the audience started to say "paoh, paoh" together.</div>

<div class="p"><b>"Cyouwa"♪</b><br />
Just after the introduction, everyone was clapping hands, which was like saying "I've been waiting for it for a long time!!"<br />
And I was very happy.</div>

<div class="p"><b>"open your eyes"♪</b><br />
Actually, I've already changed it's title… ^^;<br />
This was my first time to sing the album version, although I've sung it in Japan for many times.<br />
The singing way was a bit different, and I was more excited.<br />
Sawachika's arrangement was very nice, I could feel the France ambience.</div>

<div class="p"><b>"Atatakai Basho"♪</b><br />
This was the longest period of singing constantly since "Paris no Iro".<br />
After this song, although there were still three songs, I had already got the feeling of the live was going to the end…</div>


<div class="p">Because we have different language and religions, I very appreciate the moment when we stay together. Music is really very wonderful.<br />
Although I say it every time, I will still think about it at the next time.<br />
Then, I sang the song that fitted that moment most, "Remember the kiss English version".</div>


<div class="p"><b>"Rememberthe kiss"♪</b><br />
Extended the ending, everyone was singing "uta wo utaou, dareka no tameni (for someone you cherish, let's sing)". Just before that, I thought if I should use English, but I believed that music would link all of us together. Eventually, I sang in Japanese and encouraged everyone to sing together.</div>

<div class="p">Everyone was following the Japanese, everyone was singing "uta wo utaou, dareka no tameni".<br />
Thank you very much.</div>

<div class="p">There was still one phrase to the very end, yet everyone had already started to clap hands.<br />
I told "sh!" to imply everyone to be quiet…<br />
And the last phrase, "Remember the kiss", I finished what I was supposed to do today.</div>


<div class="p"><b>"Itsuka Dareka wo Aishita Toki"♪</b><br />
And another one,<br />
<b>"Inori nimo Nita Utsukushii Sekai"♪</b><br />
Final song. I sang it with mind staying at the time when I wrote this song for appreciating my "today".<br />
In front of the best audience, Sawachika and Matsuo's performance was also very perfect!<br />
This was really the best stage. I still wanted to sing. I still wanted to stay longer.</div>

<div class="p">Encore,<br />
<b>"Arigatou"♪</b></div>

<div class="p">The concert ended.<br />
You would never know how nice the cola tasted after the concert!!</div>
