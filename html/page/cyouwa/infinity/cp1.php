<div class="p"><h2>Chapter 1. Interview Vol.1 DVD Overview</h2></div>

<div class="p"><i>Originally published on 2009-Sep-17</i></div>

<div class="p">KOKIA started to visit Europe and have concerts since 2006. This is the fourth year. In addition to France and Belgium, she added Ireland, Poland and Germany in her visiting list, and she made the tour in large-scale. This live tour and related documentary were inscribed in the DVD suit: "Wherever I am -- world tour 2009 in Europe". Now, about the overall tour, we interviewed her.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.cdjournal.com/image/special/20090917/1/artist1.jpg" alt="" />-- No matter what kind of the project is, I always see them as "this is to be done within 3 years" or 'that is to be done within 2 years". In case of Europe tour, I think this is a 5-year project. I made my decision like "I'll do my best within in the coming 5 years, and I'll start from being active in Europe first." The first and second years are like a sowing period, and in the fourth year, I felt like "this seedling has finally grown strong enough". If I take more care on it, it will grow even better. You know? The number of guests whose faces I can recall is increasing! Like a Swiss boy who attends to lots of my lives, the girls from Cannes, and a gentleman comes from London.</div>

<div class="p">From this documentary, what we can get is the fact that her music has been in Europeans' minds deeply. Recently, you may have heard a lot about Japanese band/artist being popular in foreign countries, yet most of them was dependent on animation or other media; it's really rare that someone gaining their honour purely by their power of music. In fact, when KOKIA was still little, she had the dream to "sing in many countries but not only in Japan."</div>

<div class="p">-- Not just in Europe, I also want to sing in America and Africa, any place where my songs can not be heard on live." If you think about the question: "In what situation, the singer KOKIA will be like that shining?" Objectively, we are always close to the answer: 'the theme is love, and I wish people can be impressed by the power of voice". This will not only happen in Japan, I always believe. When I myself watch this DVD, there were such moments made me wondering: "How could I sing with such a blessed face?" Every time I watch those scenes, I truly felt "I was so glad to be able to sing here".</div>

<div class="p">As for the reason of her existence to be solid in Europe: it would be unnecessary to mention her plentiful musicianship. Her music was influenced a lot by classical music when she was studying vocal music in high school and university. Plus that there is similarity between her music and European folklores, which could also be a reason for that her music has attracted lots of local people.</div>

<div class="p">-- I think there are songs whose ambience fits Europe. Yet, I think I would probably say the same thing when I go to Africa or America. Because I've written a lot of types of songs, I used to be lost when I was asked "what are you going to write exactly?" And I wondered "Can't I choose more but only one direction?"… However, because I've written in a lot of styles, I can fit myself at everywhere. If you feel uneasy to be in the frame of J-POP, the only solution is probably to go out, isn't it?! I remember, I fitted myself well when I was meeting some gospel people before (laugh). If it's about music, it can be understood well no matter what country it is. I think it's also my forte.</div>

<div class="p">Being more mature in music skills, being more well-known in Europe… This time, her Europe tour was also done under those good conditions. Yet for KOKIA herself, that was also rather a big charge, both bodily and mentally; that could be tough for her. This was also reflected from what she said in the DVD, "I would be very happy if I can just keep my health and perform on stage like that."</div>

<div class="p">-- In fact, my health dropped down a little bit in the last year. I even felt like "I would not be able to sing anymore" for a while, and this feeling is still in my mind. Thus, on this tour, I had to pay extra attention to my body condition. Yet this was also a good thing. We don't know what would happen in future. Each time when I think about it, the wish of standing on the stage and singing with the real heart also becomes stronger. Well, in case of standing on the stage for real, no matter the condition or some else, I would just forget them and just to sing with 100% of my energy (laugh). If you ask the audience, "What's KOKIA's charm?" -- There are several interviews to the audience in the DVD -- most of people would tell you: "The voice is beautiful." So, it would be always perfect for me to stand on the stage with my best condition… In other words, I feel like I can express anything if only I can still sing.</div>

<div class="p">Besides, not only of the live performance, there are lots of scenes behind the stage, or off shots during the moving. This could be a hot point of the DVD.</div>

<div class="p">-- The camera was really around me all the time. It was like every scene was videotaped except that in the washroom (laugh). But, finally I didn't mind the camera. "I want to cherish my every time on the stage, so I don't have the time to care about the camera!" Before, my live DVD was mainly about the on-stage performance, so it was the first time to have some off-scenes. "I think you can see more about KOKIA this time"</div>

<div class="p">【3 Questions to Reveal KOKIA's Charm】</div>

<div class="p">★What are your favourite colours?<br />
A. Colours… I like a lot of colours. Mauve. Bright yellow. Golden-brown. Because colours I like for my wear, or for a place I stay, or just for viewing… all of them are different. Colour is an important item for me.</div>

<div class="p">★What are your favourite books?<br />
A. Books… this is really a difficult question. I don't read books often. Well, to encourage myself, I"m browsing books about Tarou Okamoto.</div>

<div class="p">★And your favourite movies?<br />
A. Lots of. I like movies very much. I'll just list some titles here. What I thought up immediately were "Kimi ni Yomu Monogatari" and "Out of Africa".</div>
