<div class="p"><h2>Chapter 2. Interview Vol.2 @France</h2></div>

<div class="p">In the last time, KOKIA was interviewed generally about the Live &amp; Documentary DVD "Wherever I am ～ world tour 200 9 in Europe ～". Since this time, the interview will be about the memories of the tour in France, Ireland, Poland, Belgium and Germany. Now, let's begin from the France part.</div>

<div class="p">-- That was your fourth time to have live in France. Do you feel like in your home field?</div>

<div class="p">-- I feel this all the time when I was in Europe. I don't remember if I've mentioned it in the DVD: if I'm asked how to begin my tour, the answer will always have things like "to begin from Paris".</div>

<div class="p">-- Why do you choose Paris to begin your plan in Europe?</div>

<div class="p">-- Well, there's not a reason (laugh) specially, just because I was firstly asked if I would like to have lives by people from France. But I know, not only in Paris, there are lots of people are interested in Japan and Japanese culture.</div>

<div class="p">-- There were three lives in all in Paris.</div>

<div class="p">-- Yeah. Concert hall, on a boat, and live house. To match those three different situations, I paid extra attention to choose the stage atmosphere, the set-list, the dress, as well as the tension during a MC. Thus, even though all were held in France, they could see different kinds of KOKIA. I believe they were happy -- actually I think there were people who attended to all the three -- and we were very happy to do it too.</div>

<div class="p">The first place of live in France, "LA CIGALE".<br />
People were gathering before the live.</div>

<div class="p">-- I see. The first one was at "LA CIGALE". It was a very beautiful place, wasn't it?</div>

<div class="p">-- Yeah, really. In my opinion, I can feel it has a long history. Before that, I've ever heard from France people about that "LA CIGALE is a very traditional place; to have concert there is very wonderful". I finally made it this time, and I was very happy.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.cdjournal.com/image/special/20090917/2/live5.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">The audience was standing up!</div>

<div class="p">-- Also, that was the only live with the full band among the tour.</div>

<div class="p">-- This was the first live among the four years (of Europe tours) we had the 4 members. We thought it would be very nice to have the similar stage style with what we had in Japan. It was also an evidence to tell people who attended my live before "isn't this time different from previous ones?". Just, for me, every live is the same. Because no matter what kind of live it is -- with one guitar or with my piano solo -- I will just sing with the same heart; although band members may be different, my singing power will not change.</div>

<div class="p">-- Did you feel nervous on your first day of the tour?</div>

<div class="p">-- I can't say that I didn't feel nervous at all. But, I thought that as a adjustment before the stage. I have probably got the ability to control my own feeling, and to not to turn my nervousness weird.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.cdjournal.com/image/special/20090917/2/live2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">After the live, with all band members.</div>

<div class="p">-- In the second day, the live on the boat was a special project, right?</div>

<div class="p">-- Yeah, that was. Moreover, since that was on Seine, it made me having more tension. You see, if it's in just a music hall, it would take much of effort to project some beautiful scenery. But on a boat, the scenery itself is changing all the time! I could also see the Eiffel Tower, that was such an perfect location! Firstly, I was asked "would you like to have a live on boat?" from people in France though.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.cdjournal.com/image/special/20090917/2/live3.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Second live, on a boat!</div>

<div class="p">-- Via watching the DVD, enjoyed the ambience of being an audience (laugh)?</div>

<div class="p">-- Very romantic. Maybe you haven't noticed, the couples sitting in back…</div>

<div class="p">-- Kiss?</div>

<div class="p">-- Yup! Not only in France, in every country there were people attending my live for a love ambience. Seeing from the stage, they were all very pleasant moments. I could see how blessed they were. Actually, the ratio of couples who attend KOKIA lives are rather high.</div>

<div class="p">-- Did you get into the vacances mood?</div>

<div class="p">-- Nope, never. I was only considering on keeping a good body condition, and to end the tour smoothly. Actually I was always rather tense.</div>

<div class="p">-- It was so different from what we saw during the tour. Well, what about things looked like vacances…?</div>

<div class="p">-- Nothing (laugh)! Well, at most, they included that we went to the front of hotel, or the beach. Others went to visit the world heritage, but I went to nothing of them.</div>

<div class="p">-- At least you enjoyed their food?</div>

<div class="p">-- Well, until the end of each live, I almost ate nothing. Each live began at a rather time, so I was hungry like mad after the live (laugh). Thus, I could eat as twice as normal…… Somehow, those days were like an athlete in contests. I thought almost nothing except about the concerts; I'd to keep a regular life style, I thought.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.cdjournal.com/image/special/20090917/2/live1.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">KOKIA was singing in a perfect situation.</div>

<div class="p">-- So you meant a kind of stoic life style? Then what about the third day's live?</div>

<div class="p">-- My condition was not that good in fact. You will see that I coughed for a few times in the DVD. I thought I was having an allergy. I didn't feel good when I stayed in the dressing room, so I didn't go back during the interlude. I went to the guest seating and listened to the music.</div>

<div class="p">-- But that live had such a nice ambience, no?</div>

<div class="p">-- Yeah. Maybe that was the best one among the three days. Maybe it was because of my thinking about "I will go to another country tomorrow, and I was saying to the audience in Paris: 'I thank all of you, and I'll still do my best from tomorrow!'" (laugh).</div>
