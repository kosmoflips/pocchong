<h2>2010.10.23 - Cologne ♪</h2>

<div class="p">I was in London just now...</div>

<div class="p">"Where am I? Who is this?"</div>

<div class="p">Awaking from the dream, we arrived in Cologne.</div>

<div class="p">This condition would be the last time no matter in the past or in future,<br />
and I was extremely feeling well.</div>

<div class="p">Because, at such time, you can see such a smile, from the PA, Ishigane. ^_^/</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/colo2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Now, PA's table (mixer) has been in its old age.<br />
Because of being lack of care? Even a small shock<br />
may cause it having a large noise.<br />
It must have been used in lots of rock concerts, which have tons of explosions.</div>

<div class="p">Plus, the tweeter (one of them) was placed too far away,<br />
so it may loss some sounds ^^; can we manage all of them out?!</div>

<div class="p">You see, Matsuo and I were also in the difficult condition,<br />
but the most difficult one must be the PA engineer Ishigane.</div>

<div class="p">The PA-table that has noise when being touched,<br />
or the PA-table being silent when not being touched.<br />
If it was you, what would you do?</div>

<div class="p">Of course, even though, Ishigane was smiling and working by his best. ^^</div>

<div class="p">Everyone was getting stronger from the Europe tour.<br />
So was I, little by little.<br />
I always think how well it would go if we were in Japan.</div>

<div class="p">↓ Waiting for the rehearsal, I ran out of my battery.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/colo4.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">↓ After charging, singing with enthusiastically.</div>

<div class="p">"I am trying my best, so Ishigane and Matsuo also try your best!"<br />
From my real heart.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/colo5.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">This was the second time I have been in Cologne.<br />
Except for some familiar faces, I saw a lot of new ones.<br />
r "Please go to Berlin, and also Frankfurt."</div>

<div class="p">I was really happy to hear such voices.<br />
The seeds in Cologne have sprouted, and will it bloom in next year?</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/colo6.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">It will be the final stage for 2010 REAL WORLD Europe tour tomorrow.<br />
Go to Paris, and then go back home, where people are waiting for me and saying "welcome back".</div>
