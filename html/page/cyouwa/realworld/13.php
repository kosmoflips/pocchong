<h2>2010.10.17 - Toulouse ♪</h2>

<div class="p">Departed from Barcelona, we arrived in Toulouse.<br />
Look! I found the best good design on the way to the live house!</div>

<div class="p">↓ "Cloud-bone"</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/tou_nakamura2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Though it was a bit surprising, they used nails for the new design.<br />
Matsuo looked very interested in it, and he took a picture with his phone.</div>

<div class="p">By the way, before today's stage,<br />
I met some fans who were waiting for me outside of the live house.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/tou_nakamura3.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">And another one who welcomed me was a French Bulldog, "Kahya"↓<br />
With some ham and cheese from the catering,<br />
Kahya was looking at me and like saying "gimme tham~~".</div>

<div class="p">My doggies must be living well at home. I miss them~.<br />
And we had an even calmer time in today's dressing room.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/tou_nakamura4.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Today's stage was in completely new style of the ground.</div>

<div class="p">It opened at 8:00, and began at 9:00, but the ticket was opened at 7:00.<br />
Thus, the audience were lined up very early outside in the cold day.</div>

<div class="p">This time, I have saw many times,<br />
and I asked the staff in Marseille,<br />
"Why the real show time is different from what on the poster or the leaflets?"<br />
"The audience won't come on time, so we did it on purpose." they answered.<br />
But I was really surprised ＾＾；</div>

<div class="p">This point is also very different from that in Japan~</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/tou_nakamura6.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Today's stage, as usual, I got a very happy and cosy time<br />
when I looked at the audience's smile.</div>

<div class="p">The same like in Poland, as the encore, everyone was singing "What a wonderful world" with me♪</div>

<div class="p">another unforgettable moment.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/tou_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">A cold, cold night in Toulouse.<br />
Finally finished all three stages in a row, with smile and accomplishment,<br />
even the night wind was so comfortable and pleasant.</div>

<div class="p">Today we were also cheered with shuwa-shuwa,<br />
and tomorrow we will be on a break in this city.</div>

<div class="p">A nice box.</div>

<div class="p">Well, everyone needs to do some laundry work tomorrow...</div>
