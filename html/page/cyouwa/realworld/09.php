<h2>2010.10.13 - Munich ♪</h2>

<div class="p">Left Vienna, we went toward Munich, Germany.<br />
As usual, in our tour-car, "Do Your Best",<br />
we are excited by "Daihinmin".</div>

<div class="p">If there was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotatsu" target="_blank">kotatsu</a>, it could really be a ski-trip.</div>

<div class="p">Poland, Austria, and now Munich.<br />
In these days, the countries we have visited were all very cold.<br />
We still have to wear coat and muffler.</div>

<div class="p">Moving on a land route, sometimes we can be late due to the traffic jam.</div>

<div class="p">In that case, the time for the rehearsal would be less,<br />
and thus, Matsuo always check his guitar before our arrival.</div>

<div class="p">It is surprisingly comfortable in our "Do Your Best".</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://kokia.com/blog/Image/mun7(1).jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">↑ Matsuo's home position. A position being like a sofa-bed.</div>

<div class="p">We finally arrived in the coldness.</div>

<div class="p">「・＿・」</div>

<div class="p">Th, this is a rock box...</div>

<div class="p">In this year's tour, there were a lot of new challenges,<br />
which were not included in last year's.</div>

<div class="p">For example, I have been on lives in Paris for 4 years,<br />
maybe there are a lot of people will decide to attend my live<br />
if they know the information.</div>

<div class="p">It is like my seeds have sprouted.</div>

<div class="p">Now, in the fifth year, I would try to spread seeds in somewhere I have never tried before,<br />
and this is the challenge I meant.</div>

<div class="p">Countries I visited in last year, including Belgium, Ireland, Poland and Germany,<br />
it actually could not be called a real Europe tour, because the number was rather small.<br />
It is just like in case of Japan, together with Tokyo,<br />
I only visit a few other cities, like Oosaka, Fukuoka, and Nagoya.</div>

<div class="p">But in this year, like I added Kanazawa, Aomori, and Shikoku in my list...<br />
this is a new challenge for me to sing "my first song" in somewhere I have not performed,</div>

<div class="p">Also, in Europe, there are some live houses are more rock-music-like,<br />
which are rare for me to have lives if it was in Japan.</div>

<div class="p">And today's one is a typical example.</div>

<div class="p">This place fits Matsuo, who represents "<a href="http://www.thetrophyz.com/" target="_blank">The Trophyz</a>", so well,<br />
thus, KOKIA will go to the side... ^^; (before the performance)</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://kokia.com/blog/Image/mun6_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Even though, if the show begins, no matter where I am,<br />
I will just sing as I am, and embrace the audience with my voice.
 "Thank you. Thank you very much."</div>

<div class="p">People were crowded. Of course I got a good feeling,<br />
and I more like the unity between the stage and the audience's feelings.</div>

<div class="p">The audience from Munich had such nice smiles!</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://kokia.com/blog/Image/mun3.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">After the performance, during the autograph &amp; talking session,<br />
one thing surprised me a lot.</div>

<div class="p">"I very like the dog you posted in your blog."</div>

<div class="p">Like this, people from foreign countries also have fun with my blog?<br />
I was so glad to see that the circle gathering at "otonami" is getting bigger and bigger.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://kokia.com/blog/Image/mun4_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">"Ah, are titti, Muu, and Nero living well?"</div>

<div class="p">Being staying in Japan, KOKI-Mama sent me some photos of titti<br />
when she brought her to work,<br />
titti was occupying in front of the computer, and looked like disrupting others' work. ^^;</div>

<div class="p">Although miss you guys, I will still do my best here.<br />
There will no any sprout if I do not spread the seeds,<br />
and if I do not take care of them, they cannot live well either.</div>

<div class="p">Now, as tonight's ending menu, of course,<br />
being in Germany, it must be beer and sausage!! Yummy!! ＾＿＾／</div>
