<h2>2010.10.11 - Poland  → Vienna, A Moving Day</h2>

<div class="p">After we left Poland, which was even colder than Moscow (?),<br />
today was a moving day toward Vienna, Austria.</div>

<div class="p">No matter how many hours we spent on the road,<br />
I would never get bored by the outside pastoral sceneries and each country's unique atmosphere.</div>

<div class="p">Through Poland and Czech Republic, we were driving toward Vienna.<br />
During the moving, out of our expectation, the hero of the caravan-tour became the ski-area-standard (?)<br />
card game!</div>

<div class="p">Five of us were all excited by "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daifug%C5%8D" target="_blank">Daihinmin</a>".</div>

<div class="p">Because we were in a camping-car,<br />
we had a table for the game.<br />
and we were all in this simple game.</div>

<div class="p">Sometimes, we could not see high buildings in Europe.</div>

<div class="p">The sky was endless, and there must be a lot of places for your free imagination.</div>
