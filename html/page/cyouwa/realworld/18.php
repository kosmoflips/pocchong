<h2>2010.10.21 - Brest → Calais, A Moving Day</h2>

<div class="p">After the stage in Brest, we are going to London.<br />
We were going across the Strait of Dover by ferry.</div>

<div class="p">The course was along the west France,<br />
and there, we saw the world legacy Mont Saint-Michel.</div>

<div class="p">↓ Mont Saint-Michel, we are finally here! ＾＿＾／</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/mon5.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">It looked like occupying the entire sky,<br />
yet it was very different from the sky-slashing-like high buildings in cities.</div>

<div class="p">I have never been here during these years,<br />
the time was not good; there was no good chance...<br />
but now, after those pitiful stories, I am finally here.</div>

<div class="p">This time, we could see it well on our way, amazing.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/mon1.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">↑ It is very famous that this beach will be covered fully by a full tide.</div>

<div class="p">The day when we were here had a full moon, a day of the highest tide.<br />
During several hours, the beach was covered by the veil of wave little by little.</div>

<div class="p">However, to connect the cloister over the sea and the mainland,<br />
and to stop the tide, as a result, the sand at the sea bottom decreased 2 meters.</div>

<div class="p">Therefore, people used to be able to see the cloister being shaking with the waves,<br />
but now such a scenery just disappeared.</div>

<div class="p">A bit lonely story.</div>

<div class="p">Walking on the steps of the maze-like cloister, going up and down...</div>

<div class="p">Like the time stopped, there was a place attracted me the most.<br />
I felt like hearing the sound of praying.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/mon4.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Walking through the stages, and the scenery was just like what I saw there.<br />
"Music is like a prayer", for me, this song is like my prayer,<br />
Kneel at there, and pray with calmness.</div>

<div class="p">I also want to see Mont Saint-Michel in the twilight.<br />
Maybe I will have the chance later.</div>

<div class="p">〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜</div>

<div class="p">Then, we went to a famous omelet restaurant,<br />
which was noted by Musshu Nakamura, our camera man.</div>

<div class="p">Opened the menu, because the words "try to challenge if you are brave!!", I tried the omelet!<br />
A pleasant and sweet scent of bread and eggs was in the restaurant.</div>

<div class="p">I was so excited. ^^</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/mon2_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">The soft and delicious omelet was so big, out of my expectation.<br />
And the price was very good. ^^;</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/mon2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">.....................</div>

<div class="p">It was a shame that we did not have any images after that. ^^;<br />
So, if you are wondering how it tasted, please go there and try.<br />
That was a taste that would not betray your thinking of "not good omelet".</div>

<div class="p">As a gift, as well as our tour good, we bought the Mont Saint-Michel cards!<br />
There is still a long way to go, let's continue our "Daihinmin"</div>

<div class="p">"Why not!"</div>
