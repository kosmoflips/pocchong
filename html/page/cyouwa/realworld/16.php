<h2>2010.10.19 - Toulouse → Vannes, A Moving Day</h2>

<div class="p">Today is another moving day. There was a moving of about 10 hours<br />
from Toulouse to Vannes, in our van "Do Your Best".</div>

<div class="p">On the way, at every gas station,<br />
it was slightly different according to the country or the area we were in, which was very interesting even just looking at it.<br />
Today, at noon, we found a yummy bakery.</div>

<div class="p">↓ Kyusshu.Rolenu (to pronounce French is so hard ^^;)<br />
Taking advantage of this trip, I was learning some French words<br />
of things I saw from our driver, J, everyday.</div>

<div class="p">Although not learning in a way like a child,<br />
I could remember more if I read it for more times.</div>

<div class="p">As usual, we are still playing cards enthusiastically in our camping car.<br />
To keep my throat in a good condition, I had to control to not overuse it.<br />
But it was still fun to play while keeping silence!</div>

<div class="p">"Pass, pass, and pass..." Just with smile, time went by.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/van19_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Playing cards, taking a nap on the cot, looking outside, and time went by.</div>

<div class="p">Maybe it sounds happy, but the heater of our car was broken,<br />
and you could not imagine how cold it was. ^^;</div>

<div class="p">Everyone was wearing the heat-tech, yet still talking about the heavy clothing. ^^;</div>

<div class="p">Like, maybe we can take them off when there is more sunlight.</div>

<div class="p">And we were really doing our best.</div>

<div class="p">When we arrived the harbor city, Vannes, it was dark already.<br />
It seemed there was no restaurants or stores being open.</div>

<div class="p">Yet in the restaurant of the hotel, we still enjoyed a lot because the city was near the sea.<br />
However, I was afraid to get a stomachache, and was very careful toward the shellfish.</div>

<div class="p">Everyone enjoyed the oyster, scallop, and perch.<br />
No matter where we go, it seems that delicious food and people's smile are<br />
the best recover medicine.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/van3_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Tomorrow morning we are going to Brest, and in the night, it will be a stage there.<br />
In this night, I, amazingly, got up and looked at the sky.<br />
The moon was close to a full moon, and it was shimmering with strength in the gentle and silent light.</div>
