<h2>2010.10.10 - Poznan ♪</h2>

<div class="p">We arrived at Poznan in Poland from Moscow.</div>

<div class="p">We were in Russia this morning, but suddenly,<br />
flying through Munich and Berlin, finally we were on our caravan, "REAL WORLD TOUR",<br />
which was called "Do Your Best" in another way,<br />
continued from last year, we were going toward Poland's Blue note.</div>

<div class="p">↓ This is our "Do Your Best".<br />
There are 5 beds, plus bathroom, wash room, and a mini-kitchen.</div>

<div class="p">Like this, we should overcome our rigor schedule!? ^^; I believe.</div>

<div class="p">In last year's Europe tour, this stage was the most impressive one,<br />
the sense of unity from the audience gave me a very good memory.<br />
Now I was very happy to be back to this place.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/po1.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p"><font color="#444444">The live house was like STB <font color="#C27BA0">(*a Japanese live house)<font color="#444444">, and there were still a lot of people this time.<br />
My greeting after one year!</div>

<div class="p"><font color="#444444">「ジェンドーブラ　イェツテム　KOKIA＾＿＾／」<br />
<font color="#C27BA0">(*I don't understand Polish, I have to guess KOKIA was greeting in Polish... orz)</div>

<div class="p">The audience's clapping was welcoming me.<br />
"Ah, I'm so happy!" with this feeling, "I still want to sing more!"</div>

<div class="p">In the happy ambience, today's encore was...</div>

<div class="p">"What a wonderful world" ♪</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/po.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">The audience began to clap as soon as I sang the first world.<br />
Like to be closer to my song, everyone was singing together.</div>

<div class="p">Gently, with "What a wonderful world~♪", this moment was blessed,<br />
and I was really, really in seventh heaven.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/po2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">This world is really wonderful, and I want to discover more and more such wonders.</div>

<div class="p">On the stage in Poznan, we shared much of love and happiness.</div>

<div class="p">Although it was in a rush between the moving from Moscow and today's stage,<br />
this time, this moment, I will never forget.</div>

<div class="p">Humans are living by their hearts. Today, I felt it a lot.</div>

<div class="p">Of course, now I am going to take a good rest. Good night, see you tomorrow.</div>
