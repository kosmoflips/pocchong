<div class="p">The fifth year's Europe tour.</div>

<div class="p">I am very happy to visit more countries and have more concerts.</div>

<div class="p">This year's schedule is not that calm comparing with last year's,<br />
but, I hope I will have much of memory about "this or that has happened" afterwards,<br />
I also hope my heart will be full of new graceful events.</div>

<div class="p">In the fifth year, Europe is closer to me.<br />
I have gone to lots of places in Japan during this summer,<br />
and now, I feel like Europe is the extension, where I can share my songs with more people.</div>

<div class="p">Things happened in the past five years are like phantasmagorical.<br />
I have such a feeling: the fifth tour is not the thing you can plan beforehand,<br />
you have to touch all your memories, plus your steps, they will become the very trip: this year's tour.</div>

<div class="p">I am off, and hope to see you again in somewhere in Japan.</div>
