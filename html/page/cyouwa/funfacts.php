<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<div class="p">- Why "KOKIA"?<br />
- KOKIA, real name is Akiko Yoshida (吉田亜紀子). KOKIA is the reversed version of writing her name "A-KI-KO". Oy... THAT'S ALSO KOKIA-GO (see below ^^)!!</div>

<div class="p">- Composing, writing lyrics, and arranging, which is the most diffucult for KOKIA?<br />
- Arrangement definitely! For KOKIA, composing is like writing diary, and writing lyrics is like expressing what she wants to say; yet arranging needs accurate calculation, excellent music sense, and much of knowledge.</div>

<div class="p">- When new CD releases, KOKIA will...<br />
- buy this CD with her own money as a ceremony. At that moment, she feels like "my baby was finally born." ^_^</div>

<div class="p">- What is KOKIA語 (KOKIA-go, KOKIA-words)?<br />
- A self-made language that KOKIA used in a few songs, including "cyouwa", "follow the nightingale", "Shizuku no Uta ~song of pocchong~", "Lydia ~Fairy Dance~", "gematria", and so on. There is not a firm rule of making KOKIA-words (at least I don't know there is one... ^^;); the way of making "cyouwa" and "gematria" is very different.</div>

<div class="p">- KOKIA has a self-made film?<br />
- Yes. She made the film "Grandfather's Tulip" in memory of her grandfather. She wrote the song "nukumori~aigakikoeru~" during that period when her family members went to the hospital in turn and looked after her grandfather. This song was the theme song of the film.</div>

<div class="p">- KOKIA and dogs.<br />
- She loves dogs very much. The song "Arigatou... (thank you)" was written for one of her dogs, which died when she was 16. Currently, she has a few dogs, including Titti, which you may see lots of times from her blog photos.</div>

<div class="p">- What is the KOKIA-elephant?<br />
- The image of an elephant (commonly in pink) that appears as a symbol of KOKIA related things. This image was already designed around her "trip trip" time (2002). There is a song "Pinku no Zou" from that album, which means "Pink Elephant". This could probably be an image song for her symbol. (She mentioned about it in her 10th anniversary memorial book, I need to check it and update for more details ^^;)</div>

<div class="p">- "otonami"??<br />
- This is the title of KOKIA's blog. Otonami, which means "sea of sound" in Japanese literally.</div>
