<div class="p"><b>ありがとう / Arigatou...</b><br />
KOKIA wrote it for her died dog when she was 16. This is one of her most famous songs, as well as her debut work.</div>

<div class="p"><b>エリカ / Erika</b><br />
According to KOKIA's blog, this song should be for KOKIA's friend who's called "Erika". From the lyrics, you can also feel like this is a song for her best friend.</div>

<div class="p"><b>歌う人 / Utau Hito</b><br />
A song written for KOKIA herself. The title means "singer".</div>

<div class="p"><b>二人の娘 / Futari no Musume</b><br />
A song for KOKIA and her older sister. They were always fighting to each other, because both of them was jealous the other. Then, their mother said: "You're the sun, and your sister is the moon; you're all nice, and no one can be missing.</div>

<div class="p"><b>ぬくもり ～aigakikoeru～</b><br />
This song was written for KOKIA's grandfather. She got the inspiration during the days when they went to the hospital to look after her grandfather. "It's so wonderful that I can feel the existence of life. He's breathing, and that is enough." Later, KOKIA made a short film, which was called "Grandfather's Tulip", in memory of him; this song was used as the theme song.</div>

<div class="p"><b>祈りにも似た美しい世界 / Inori nimo Nita Utsukushii Sekai</b><br />
KOKIA's psalm, to the god in music. Very beautiful.</div>

<div class="p"><b>les couleurs de Paris - パリの色 / Paris no Iro</b><br />
This song was written based on KOKIA's image of Paris. She sang it specially for fans in Paris. She said Currently, as far as I know, there is no any albums and singles including this song. The only place where you can find it is the concert DVD.</div>

<div class="p"><b>私にできること / Watashi ni Dekiru Koto</b><br />
KOKIA wrote this song to encourage and comfort the people suffering from the earthquake in Niigata, Kashiwazaki. She knew it from Y-ko, an ancoro (the way she calls her club members). That mail later became an inspiration of writing this song. KOKIA firstly send the mp3 file to Y-ko, and this song was widely played on the radio. KOKIA also went to there for many times, sang for people living in there. This song, plus "Lacrima" were included in a single under the same title, part of the income from iTunes store was used to help people in Niigata.</div>

<div class="p"><b>Ave Maia</b><br />
It was her first time to cover a classical song. Commonly, to recording a classical work should not be in a regular studio, but a real music hall. According to KOKIA blog, it was very different from recording other songs, it was a big effort to make it perfect. Yeah... this is really perfect!</div>

<div class="p"><b>Everlasting</b><br />
A song for non-Japanese fans. (I got this from amazon reviews ^^;)</div>

<div class="p"><b>小さなうた / Chiisana Uta</b><br />
KOKIA likes songs with large scales, and she also likes quiet ambience. After finished "Watashi ni Dekiru Koto", she was trying to write a "little" song, and that's this one.</div>

<div class="p"><b>花宴 / Hana Utage</b><br />
Seems this song was originally born around March 13, 2007. KOKIA wrote in her blog at that day: "Today, I made a nice song for spring. I will have a concert in Nara in April. I very want to sing a song for spring there. Thus, I tried to image this desire and sang it out. The song is currently called 'Hana Utage', let's enjoy it then.</div>

<div class="p"><b>usaghi</b><br />
This song was kind of an image song describing a dream KOKIA had a few times when she was little: in the background of a merry-go-round, the lonely rabbit was dead silently...<br />
It might has the similar image as another song "Daiji na Mono wa Mabuta no Ura". However, even though things like "merry-go-round" or "waltz" sound cute, the whole image seems somewhat scary...</div>

<div class="p"><b>星屑のヴォカリーズ / Hoshikuzu no Vocalise</b><br />
This song was written for KOKIA's grandmother. In her blog, there was a photo of the vast, silent, deep blue night sky. "The colour, the deep blue, is just like the sea. The sea my grandfather loved. Now, they are finally together again... </div>

<div class="p"><b>ゲマトリア / gematria</b><br />
Derived from KOKIA's feeling of listening the sound of reading sutra during a Buddhist memorial service. From her blog, she said that the feeling was not related to any religions, yet that was like people's souls were purified along that sound. The reason for KOKIA to use this title was probably that she wrote the original lyrics for the song, and then separated the whole passage into word-units, and rearranged all those units to become a new kind of KOKIA-words. (Make sense? ^^;) </div>

<div class="p"><b>おばあちゃん / Obaa-chan</b><br />
Apparently a song in memory of KOKIA's grandmother.</div>

<div class="p"><b>vintage love</b><br />
For KOKIA herself, this song was an image for the movie "Tokyo Tower" where Hitomi Kuroki was in.</div>

<div class="p"><b>single mother</b><br />
The song is like a story, yet it was must based on KOKIA's own life: she and her single mother.</div>

<div class="p"><b>この地球がまるいお陰で / kono chikyuu ga marui okagede</b><br />
Lying on the Sahara Desert, looking at the vast sky. That was a kind of impression that cannot be expressed by words. Being strongly touched by the sight, KOKIA wrote this song. "Because the earth is round, everyone is in the center of the world; because the earth is round, we can meet someday." (from KOKIA 2010 Oto no Tabi bito concert MC)</div>
