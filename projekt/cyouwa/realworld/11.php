<h2>2010.10.15 - Marseille ♪</h2>

<div class="p">My performance in Marseille is on today.<br />
Although I have visited a lot of places in this tour,<br />
the performance in Marseille is the first one in France.</div>

<div class="p">It has been the fifth year I have lives in Paris.<br />
Now, not only in Paris, I will have lives in 4 cities in France:<br />
Marseille, Toulouse, Brest, and Paris.</div>

<div class="p">It is my first time to have live in Marseille, yet after the visiting of other countries,<br />
I felt like being at "home". It is so amazing.</div>

<div class="p">I'm really looking forward that~.</div>

<div class="p">The schedule of this tour is really forceful, but in a lot of countries,<br />
there was an interview before the show.</div>

<div class="p">However, although I have been told that "there will be a translator",<br />
"Spain → English", "Russian → English", "German → English",<br />
like that, there was not a Japanese translator. ^^;</div>

<div class="p">It was normal to think the translator understands Japanese,<br />
but seems that I was way too spoiled...<br />
I have to go with the world standard...</div>

<div class="p">By using the experience I got from the study in Ireland in this June (?),<br />
I finished these interviews anyhow, with my smile, of course. ＾＿＾／</div>

<div class="p">A French-like colourful dressing room.<br />
Open a small trunk, there was my dresser.<br />
The time for making-up before the real performance, and I was going into the mood little by little.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/mar3_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">"Bonsoir à tous ＾＿＾／"</div>

<div class="p">A stage began with smile.<br />
In the moment, I really thought "ah, this is home".</div>

<div class="p"><font color="#333333" face="arial, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#444444" size="3"></div>

<div class="p"><font color="#333333" face="arial, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#444444" size="3">The first time of having a live in Marseille, but I did have a good time<br />
<font color="#333333" face="arial, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#444444" size="3">to see how my seeds going outside of Paris.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/mar.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">From today, there will be three stages in a row.</div>

<div class="p">To ensure that everyone can get my world,<br />
we did a lot to make a good set-list, which is not as simple as what you only to tell.<br />
It has to make people feel "at that time, at that space, you heard my song."</div>

<div class="p">My tour is still going,<br />
but I have the confidence that it can go very will till the last moment.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/mar5_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">And the reason became the smile.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/mar7_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">I want to go to meet everyone in the world.</div>

<div class="p">I want to sing for you with my heart.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/mar8_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Even though the language, the culture, and the color of skin are all different,<br />
when we smile, I feel how amazing music is, and how amazing singing is, again and again.</div>

<div class="p">Also, I appreciate that I can still sing today.</div>

<div class="p">Tomorrow we are going to Barcelona, Spain.</div>
