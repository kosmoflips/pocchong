<h2>2010.10.01 - Budapest, Hungary</h2>

<div class="p">Departed from Narita, I arrived at Budapest, Hungary.<br />
From the plane, I saw the night of Budapest was so beautiful,<br />
and I was surprised by the simple yet full-of-warmth sign of life.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/b13.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">I am so glad to sing in this place, where I have not been in before,<br />
and I am very excited by the people I am going to meet.</div>

<div class="p">Actually, the performance in Budapest is not included in "REAL WORLD" Europe Tour;
 This show is for an expo.<br />
Therefore (?), without thinking on "The Europe tour has begun!!"<br />
I feel like we can have a happy experience here.</div>

<div class="p">↓ The T-shirt for 2010's Europe Tour.<br />
(It is so adorable to see Hungary being written here ^^;)</div>

<div class="p">Except the black and white T-shirts, there are also postcards and posters.<br />
↓ Comparing with Japan, Foreign countries have more goods for shows.</div>

<div class="p">To see the stage of the Expo, which will be opened tomorrow, beforehand, we moved to the place quickly! ↑<br />
Tres bien! That's so wide! Seems there will be 1500-2000 people coming here.<br />
It's also a good chance to get the number of KOKIA-fans increased,<br />
I have to do my best!!</div>

<div class="p">In the firstly-visited street, we scrolled out by subway.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/b4.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">↓ Franz Liszt Academy of Music. There are several classmates of high school and university being studying here.<br />
This is a famous music academy for classical music.<br />
They are making a stage; looks like there will be a concert.</div>

<div class="p">↓ Hungary? To people who think on what kind of place it is and what kind of food it has.<br />
So this is today's lunch!!<br />
Among Hungarian sparkling water, this is a delicious soup called "goulash (?)".<br />
Like the Japanese minestrone, this soup can make your body warm and it's very delicious.</div>

<div class="p">When the body is still warm, we went to Danube -- we are in Hungary now!<br />
Thus, we strolled alone the river.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/b10.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">It has another ambience comparing with Paris' Seine.</div>

<div class="p">I really like cities have a big river inside of it.<br />
Only look at the river flowing at its own pace, I feel like I have thousands of thinkings sparking out.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/b11.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Danube has a dignified feeling, which may make people feeling of the long history.<br />
Liszt, Bartók, Kodály... did they all inspired by such scene?</div>

<div class="p">Now I'm looking forward tomorrow's stage.<br />
And I got very surprised by the quickness of the elevator in Hungary.<br />
I thought that speed would not be that good for the elder.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/b12.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Maybe I should say in a more attractive way...<br />
Be careful, everyone!</div>
