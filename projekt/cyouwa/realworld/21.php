<h2>2010.10.24 - Paris ♪</h2>

<div class="p">Paris.</div>

<div class="p">The very place where I began to spread the seeds 5 years ago.</div>

<div class="p">Since that, 5 years have passed by.</div>

<div class="p">Among 9 countries and 11 concerts, this time,<br />
as the 12nd one, the final stage, we entered in Theatre Michel.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/pa7_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">The red carpet was full of enthusiasm and pleasure.<br />
With the audience's saying of "welcome back" and their smile and clapping,<br />
I went on the stage.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/pa2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">During the 3 weeks, I visited a lot of countries in Europe.<br />
I have been keeping challenging to sing in Europe during the 5 years.</div>

<div class="p">Now, the scenery where I am gives me endless happiness,<br />
and also gives me the courage to continue in future.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/pa5_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">This feeling, this emotion, I wanted to express in words.<br />
Together with my 5 years of challenging in Europe, I have been an independent musician for 5 years.</div>

<div class="p">As the relay of "Inochi no Hikari (Light of Life)"♪, I now have "Watashi ga mita mono (things I see)"♪,<br />
and further, I will still write down what I feel, and what I think.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/pa6_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">I really, really thank everyone who attended to my concerts,<br />
and who is keeping supporting me.</div>

<div class="p">I am going back to Japan tomorrow.</div>
