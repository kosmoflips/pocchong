<h2>2010.10.16 - Barcelone ♪</h2>

<div class="p">From Marseille, we came along the Mediterranean Sea,<br />
and we arrived at Barcelona in Spain.</div>

<div class="p">There were much of illegal parking in Marseille,<br />
large vehicles like our caravan "Do Your Best" cannot go across them easily.<br />
Thus, we spent a lot of time during the moving out of the city.</div>

<div class="p">Then in Spain, there were a huge amount of vehicles and people.<br />
The more we went close to the live house, the more difficultly we could move.<br />
Everyone had to go off and carrying the luggage by walk.</div>

<div class="p">↓ Sagrada Familia</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/bar6_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Before the performance, we tried some jamón ibérico,<br />
to give my throat enough oil. ^^</div>

<div class="p">Each time, Matsuo was like "Oh man, this is amazing, yummy!"<br />
and he is very enjoying the local food.</div>

<div class="p">Matsuo, who got his hair cut a little; Ishikane, who is challenging to gain weight of 5-kilo;<br />
Musshu Nakamura, who calls himself "nice guy" and always whispers in the back when I update my blog;<br />
and and, Hirano, who does not change and just being like usual...<br />
Everyone was happy.<br />
So am I. I am so glad to be with them during the tour.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/bar3_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">After I began to have concerts in Europe, I ever met a fan from Spain in Belgium.<br />
Since then, she was looking forward that I could have a concert in Spain every year.<br />
Now, this will be a stage, which I can see her again.</div>

<div class="p">Stages in Europe starts later than the time we usually do in Japan,<br />
and I have already known that from my previous experience.<br />
However, this time, it lasted from 22:30 to 0:00,<br />
what an unprecedented time.</div>

<div class="p">When the autograph session and every other thing were done, it was already over 25:00.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/bar4_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">It was also a day I met a Japanese girl who was studying in Milan.<br />
I met a lot of Japanese fans during the tour, who were living in there, or other European countries.</div>

<div class="p">In this or that city, another country, this place...<br />
there are always Japanese people working hard everyday, and having their own time.<br />
Suddenly I felt the world has been turned extremely smaller, and I was so happy.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/bar5_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">After that, we were told "you only need 5 minutes to walk to the hotel",<br />
and we went with all our luggage.</div>

<div class="p">... but we were fooled...<br />
5 minutes for local people actually equals 30 minutes...</div>

<div class="p">With the sleepiness, the coldness, and the long walking,<br />
although Musshu was saying he was exhausted, he helped me to carry my stuff. (Nice guy ＾＿＾／)</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/bar7_nakamura.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Tomorrow, we will be back in France again, and have a performance in Toulouse.<br />
It will be the final show of the three-in-a-row stages. Do my best~!!</div>
