<h2>2010.10.02 - Budapest ♪</h2>

<div class="p">My first stage in Budapest, Hungary.</div>

<div class="p"><font color="#444444" size="3"></div>

<div class="p"><font color="#444444" size="3">In such a even luxury place, I was full of happiness and passion.<br />
I didn't have time to think about whether there would be lot of people,<br />
or what a night I would get -- I've been far away from Japan,<br />
and finally came to the place where Danube is flowing.</div>

<div class="p">"Sziasztok" ＾＿＾／<br />
This was the first word I heard, also the first word I remembered. (Hello, everyone.)</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/buda3.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Here, I'm going to introduce "Team KOKIA 2010" in this "REAL WORLD" Europe Tour.</div>

<div class="p">↓ Ishigane the PA. Although this is the first time being overseas,<br />
Ishigane was in charge of monitors on KOKIA's recent stages in Japan.</div>

<div class="p">His smile is nice, and he eats a lot. ^^;</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/buda4.jpg" alt="" />　<img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/buda5.jpg" alt="" />　

<div class="p">Now, not with a band but only a guitar that can beat KOKIA's singing!<br />
And you all know this guitarist, that's Matsuo. ↑</div>

<div class="p">Then, of course, Hirano the manager; plus me there are four.<br />
After the performance, we are going to meet up with the camera-man, Musshu Nakamura in Paris.<br />
Include the driver for this caravan tour, J,<br />
that finishes "Team KOKIA" in 2010's "REAL WORLD" Europe Tour.</div>

<div class="p">By the way... even the trip has just begun,</div>

<div class="p">an incident that we call "Budapest Tragedy" happened. ^^;<br />
That was in the day before yesterday, just after we arrived at Hungary @_@;</div>

<div class="p">Tha... that was, Matsuo's cherished guitar got broken during the flight. Garrrhh.</div>

<div class="p">In this day, Mr. Guitar looked very pitiful on the stage.<br />
Just being like adhesive bandages, its cracks were covered by gum-tape,<br />
and it has done its work finally.</div>

<div class="p">And this night's performance was such a success.</div>

<div class="p">"Sziasztok. Hello everyone, this is KOKIA. ＾＿＾／"<br />
Even though only one word, for me, who just stood on the stage of that country,
 it was a big moment. I felt the distance between us got shortened.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/buda2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">There were much more people with huge enthusiasm. I was surprised already before the performance,<br />
but also at that time, I must also get extremely excited.</div>

<div class="p">Was that like a sport festival? It was like a bargain event, people rush into the place with its opening;<br />
I felt the atmosphere even I was behind the stage,<br />
and I said, "Ah, that is not safe~ ^^;" People went into the place in just a short while.</div>

<div class="p">"It is dangerous, really ^^;"</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/buda6(1).jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">Although the performance in Moscow is supposed to be the first day of "REAL WORLD" Europe tour,<br />
I felt this day's is rather like the first stage.<br />
I had a wonderful 90 minutes, to sing, and to tell my feelings.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/buda.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">After the performance, with the remaining excitement of being in the perfect stage,<br />
we had some delicious Hungarian wine, Tokaji. ↓</div>

<div class="p">There must have been lot of people, who listen to my songs in Hungary,<br />
and who just had their first time to listen to my songs; lot of people.</div>

<div class="p">I wonder how Hungarians feel about my songs,<br />
and I will be very glad to enjoy the connection between us.</div>

<div class="p">Before the stage, there was a Q-&amp;-A time between fans and me,<br />
it was settled in another room, and amazingly, there were some Japanese!</div>

<div class="p">Moreover, they looked like the couple who attended my concert in last December, Yohohama,<br />
I didn't ask more, but did they move to here afterwards?<br />
and this time, did they get surprised by my visiting in Budapest...?</div>

<div class="p">I was also very, very surprised!<br />
It is such a pleasure to call with a unique voice in Budapest,<br />
and thus, will the family of music get increased?<br />
if so, that is so excellent!</div>

<div class="p">Ahh, should I say this world is big? or small?<br />
Is it true that otonami (waves of sound) are calling each other?<br />
or because this world is round?</div>

<div class="p">Oh, I got a lot kinds of surprising.</div>

<div class="p"><img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/buda8.jpg" alt="" />　<img src="http://www.kokia.com/blog/Image/buda7.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="p">↑ I hope I can visit Hungary again, and then we may meet again.</div>
